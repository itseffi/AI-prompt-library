INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- `{{business_outcome}}`: The business outcome the OST must support.
- `{{journey_nodes_as_list}}`: Ordered list of journey moments (for example: `["Add to calendar", "Edit calendar", "Review calendar"]`).
- `{{interview_transcripts_or_story_snippets}}`: Interview material with speaker labels and timestamps when available.
- `{{constraints_or_principles}}` (optional): Guardrails, principles, or constraints to respect.
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Transform interview evidence into a Teresa Torres-aligned Opportunity Solution Tree with distinct, properly nested opportunity nodes by journey moment.
Success metric:
- Output includes all required parts (A-E) with complete, internally consistent references.
- Opportunity nodes are user-need statements (not solutions), evidence-linked, and structurally valid.
- Prioritization is computable and traceable to interview evidence and `{{business_outcome}}`.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs; if data is missing or ambiguous, state assumptions in Part E.
- Phrase opportunities from the end-user perspective.
- Assign each opportunity to exactly one primary moment from `{{journey_nodes_as_list}}`; if needed, list secondary moments in `alt_moments`.
- Enforce sibling distinctness: if two siblings cannot be pursued independently, merge or reframe.
- Enforce parent-child logic: solving a child must partially solve its parent.
- Remove generic parents that have only one specific child.
- Collapse duplicates into the clearest phrasing and preserve traceability.
- Keep opportunities specific when supported by quotes; keep general opportunities only when they organize multiple specific children.
- Include only opportunity nodes in the OST (no solutions).
- Preserve short supporting quotes and avoid introducing new facts not present in inputs.
- Use stable IDs and ensure all references resolve (`parent_id`, `duplicates_of`, `traceability`).

FORMAT
Return all sections below in this exact order.

Part A - Opportunity Inventory (Markdown Table)
- Include both parent and leaf opportunities.
- Use exactly these columns:
`| id | moment | opportunity_reframed (user-need) | parent_id | duplicates_of | representative_quotes | frequency_count | confidence (low/med/high) | alt_moments | notes/reframe_rationale |`
- `duplicates_of` is blank unless collapsed into another ID.

Part B - Structured OST (Strict JSON in `<ost_json>` tags)
- Output must be wrapped exactly as:
`<ost_json>`
`{ ... }`
`</ost_json>`
- JSON schema:
```json
{
  "outcome": "{{business_outcome}}",
  "moments": [
    {
      "moment": "<journey moment>",
      "tree": [
        {
          "id": "A0",
          "title": "<user need>",
          "type": "opportunity",
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "traceability": {
    "A0": {
      "quotes": ["..."],
      "frequency_count": 1,
      "confidence": "low"
    }
  }
}
```
- Every node must include `id`, `title`, `type`, `children`.
- `type` must always be `"opportunity"`.
- Top-level moments must come from `{{journey_nodes_as_list}}`.
- JSON must be valid and parseable.

Part C - Markdown Tree View (Human-readable)
- For each moment, render an indented opportunity tree:
`## <moment>`
`- <parent opportunity>`
`  - <child opportunity>`
`    - <grandchild opportunity>`
- Include opportunities only (no solutions).

Part D - Prioritized Leaf Backlog (Markdown Table)
- Include only leaf opportunities.
- Use exactly these columns:
`| id | moment | leaf_opportunity | impact (1-5) | frequency (1-5) | alignment_to_outcome (1-5) | priority_score | rationale |`
- Compute `priority_score = impact * frequency * alignment_to_outcome`.

Part E - Assumptions & Open Questions
- Include:
- Uncertainties in placement/reframing.
- Potential missing siblings to test in future interviews.
- Ambiguities or contradictory evidence in quotes.
- Any hypotheses not supported by current interview evidence.

FAILURE
- Any required part (A-E), required table column, or required JSON field is missing.
- JSON is malformed, non-parseable, or violates required schema/rules.
- Output includes solutions inside the OST opportunity tree.
- Opportunities are generic/overlapping and fail distinctness or parent-child logic.
- Claims are not traceable to interview evidence.
- IDs or references are inconsistent/unresolved.
- Priority scores are missing or incorrectly computed.
- Assumptions/ambiguities exist but are not explicitly listed in Part E.
