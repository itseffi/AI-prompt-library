INPUTS

</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Structure a complex problem into a clear analysis and actionable recommendation.
Success metric:
- Produces a concise problem simplification with key issues/stakeholders.
- Includes both deductive and inductive analysis streams.
- Synthesizes insights into a concrete recommendation with rationale.
- Follows the required output structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required steps:
  1. Simplify the problem into core components and stakeholders.
  2. Perform deductive analysis (top-down logic and option tree).
  3. Perform inductive analysis (specific evidence/patterns/examples).
  4. Synthesize both analyses (alignment/conflicts and key insight).
  5. Recommend an actionable course of action.
- Keep reasoning objective, explicit, and grounded in `PROBLEM_STATEMENT`.
- Clearly label assumptions if evidence is incomplete.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<analysis>
<simplified_problem>
[Provide a concise summary of the simplified problem]
</simplified_problem>

<deductive_analysis>
[Present your logical tree of options and ideas, including key considerations and potential outcomes]
</deductive_analysis>

<inductive_analysis>
[Discuss specific examples, data points, or patterns you've identified and their implications]
</inductive_analysis>

<synthesis>
[Explain how your deductive and inductive analyses complement or contrast with each other, and what overall insights they provide]
</synthesis>

<recommendation>
[Clearly state your recommended course of action, explaining why it's the best approach based on your analysis]
</recommendation>
</analysis>

FAILURE
- Required schema is missing or malformed.
- Any required analysis section is missing or materially incomplete.
- Deductive and inductive analyses are not clearly distinguished.
- Recommendation is generic or not supported by prior analysis.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
