INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- `{{ASSUMPTIONS}}`: Plain-text assumption list (typically with Category, `Statement: We believe that...`, and `Impact if wrong:`).
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Prioritize assumptions by strategic risk using an Importance × Certainty model.
Success metric:
- Highest-risk assumptions are clearly ranked and justified.
- Scoring is consistent and traceable to assumption impact/evidence quality.
- Output follows strict plain-text structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Focus only on prioritization; do not include validation plans, experiments, or recommendations.
- Use only provided assumptions; if Category is missing, infer one of:
- Desirability
- Feasibility
- Viability
- Usability
- Normalize duplicates before scoring (keep strongest impact framing).
- Score each assumption with:
- Importance (1-5): business/strategy impact if false.
- Certainty (1-5): strength of evidence assumption is true.
- Risk score = `Importance * (6 - Certainty)`.
- Use consistent scoring based on impact severity, blast radius, dependency risk, irreversibility/time sensitivity, and evidence quality.
- Perform decomposition/self-critique internally; report only final outcomes.
- Output must be plain text only (no XML/HTML tags, no code fences).

FORMAT
Return exactly two sections in this order and nothing else:

PRIORITIZATION
2x2 Summary (counts): HI/LC: x; HI/HC: y; LI/LC: z; LI/HC: w

Top Risks (HI/LC), ranked by Risk score (highest first). For each item, include exactly:
Assumption: "We believe that ..." (verbatim)
Category: [Desirability | Feasibility | Viability | Usability]
Importance: [1-5]
Certainty: [1-5]
Risk score: [number]
Rationale: [max 2 short bullets referencing severity, blast radius, dependency, irreversibility, or evidence quality]

Full Ranked List: All assumptions sorted by Risk score (desc). Each line:
[Rank]. [Category] - Importance:[x] Certainty:[y] Risk:[z] - "We believe that ..."

QUALITY CHECK
- 3-6 concise bullets summarizing self-critique outcomes (for example: duplicate merges, re-scored items, category balance, scoring ambiguities).
- Do not include chain-of-thought or step-by-step internal reasoning.

FAILURE
- Output includes anything beyond the two required sections or wrong section order.
- Output contains XML/HTML tags, angle-bracket wrappers, or code blocks.
- Includes validation plans/recommendations instead of prioritization-only results.
- Top Risks entries are missing required fields.
- Risk formula is not applied consistently or rankings are not sorted by Risk score descending.
- `Assumption` text is not preserved verbatim where required.
- Quality check is missing, too short (<3 bullets), or exposes internal reasoning.
