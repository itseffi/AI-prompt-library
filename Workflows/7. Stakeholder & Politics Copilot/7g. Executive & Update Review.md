INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- [No explicit variables declared; use provided context.]
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Executive & Update Review.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Review a draft executive update/deck and optimize for clarity, brevity, and decision impact.
- Rewrite `TL;DR` as exactly 3 bullets: what is wanted, why now, what changes.
- Diagnose issues with explicit `Issue -> Fix` callouts (including vague/defensive/buried lead/over-detail/missing risk or ask).
- Propose a clean narrative: Hook, Stakes, Options (with trade-offs), Recommendation, Ask (decision/resources/timeline).
- Rewrite the core section in plain language (`<=200` words).
- Provide 3-minute speaking notes with timing: opening (`15s`), body (`2m30s`), close (`15s`), including one story/data point, one risk, and one clear ask.
- Recommend slide/page economy and a one-slide executive summary layout.
- Replace hedging/passive voice with direct, credible phrasing aligned to business goals and next actions.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

TL;DR (3 bullets)
- [What I want]
- [Why now]
- [What changes]

Issue -> Fix
| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| [Issue] | [Fix] |

Narrative Structure
Hook: [text]
Stakes: [text]
Options (with trade-offs): [text]
Recommendation: [text]
Ask (decision/resources/timeline): [text]

Core Rewrite
[<=200 words plain-language rewrite]

3-Minute Speaking Notes
Opening (15s): [text]
Body (2m30s): [text including one story/data point and one risk]
Close (15s): [text with one clear ask]

Slide Economy & One-Slide Layout
Cuts/Merges: [what to remove or combine]
One-Slide Executive Summary Layout: [sections and ordering]

FAILURE
- Any required section is missing or materially incomplete.
- `TL;DR` is not exactly 3 bullets or does not map to the required three intents.
- Core rewrite exceeds 200 words or remains vague/defensive/passive.
- Speaking notes miss required timing structure, risk, story/data point, or clear ask.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
