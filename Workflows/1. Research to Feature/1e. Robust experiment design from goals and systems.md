INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- `{{GOAL}}`: Outcome to achieve or measure.
- `{{SYSTEM}}`: Context/environment where goal is pursued.
- `{{EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE}}` (optional): Required template for experiment design output.
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Design a robust, factor-based experiment program that tests what drives the target goal within the specified system.
Success metric:
- Key causal factors are identified and explained.
- Each factor has a testable experiment design with rigorous controls and measurement.
- If a template is provided, the final design is adapted to that template without losing rigor.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs; if missing/ambiguous details exist, state explicit assumptions.
- First decompose the goal/system into influential factors before proposing experiments.
- For each factor, define one concrete experiment including:
- Hypothesis
- Independent variable(s)
- Dependent variable(s)
- Control and experimental groups (or justified alternative when groups are not applicable)
- Measurement method(s) and success metric(s)
- Confounding variables and mitigation controls
- Ensure experiments are specific, feasible, and directly linked to `{{GOAL}}`.
- If `{{EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE}}` is provided, produce an adapted version that maps identified factors/experiments into that structure.
- Avoid generic methods and unsupported claims.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<experiment_design>

<factor_breakdown>
[Numbered list of key factors, each with a brief explanation of why it may influence the goal in this system.]
</factor_breakdown>

<experiment_program>
[For each factor, include:
- Factor
- Hypothesis
- Independent variable(s)
- Dependent variable(s)
- Control group / baseline
- Experimental group(s) / treatment(s)
- Measurement method and timeline
- Confounding variables and control plan
- Expected decision rule (what result confirms/refutes hypothesis)]
</experiment_program>

<template_design>
[If `{{EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE}}` is provided, present the adapted experiment design using that template; otherwise write `No template provided.`]
</template_design>

<assumptions>
[List explicit assumptions made due to unclear or missing inputs; write `None.` if no assumptions were required.]
</assumptions>

</experiment_design>

FAILURE
- Output misses required top-level tags or required experiment fields.
- Factors are generic, not tied to `{{GOAL}}`/`{{SYSTEM}}`, or missing rationale.
- Experiments lack testability (unclear variables, no control/baseline, no measurable outcomes).
- Confounders are ignored or not controlled.
- Template is provided but not used in `<template_design>`.
- Assumptions are needed but not explicitly listed.
