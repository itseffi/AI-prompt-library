INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{INTERVIEW_DATA}}
- {{FORCE_TYPE}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Clustered JTBD forces from interview data.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Analyze `{{INTERVIEW_DATA}}` to code and affinitize only the specified JTBD force type `{{FORCE_TYPE}}`.
- Conceptually construct a binary coding matrix:
- Stories as rows.
- Force concepts as columns.
- Existing concept match -> code `1`.
- Novel concept -> add new column and backfill prior rows with `0`.
- Abstract and stabilize force columns with overarching labels.
- Identify stories that introduce unique force concepts.
- Summarize structure, categories, unique contributors, and notable clustering patterns.
- Keep scope strictly to the selected force type and explicitly state assumptions if input structure is incomplete.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<analysis>
1. Spreadsheet Summary:
   [Provide a brief overview of the spreadsheet structure]

2. Force Categories:
   [List the abstract labels for each force column]

3. Unique Force Contributors:
   [List the stories that introduced unique forces]

4. Insights and Patterns:
   [Share any notable observations from the affinitizing process]
</analysis>

FAILURE
- `<analysis>` schema is missing, malformed, or materially incomplete.
- Output mixes in non-selected force types or unsupported assumptions.
- Force categories are not abstracted/stabilized or unique contributors are missing.
- Insights do not reflect coding/affinity patterns from the provided data.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
