GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: NETMBA competitor analysis.
Success metric:
- Produces a rigorous competitor analysis using Objectives, Current Strategy, Assumptions, and Capabilities.
- Converts analysis into ranked likely moves and actionable counter-moves.
- Keeps key claims auditable with explicit source tags and confidence levels.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs; if key fields are missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Use Porter/NETMBA competitor model components explicitly:
  - Objectives, Current Strategy, Assumptions, Capabilities.
- Separate facts from inferences; mark inferred claims with `(Inference)` and source tags `[S#]` when indirectly supported.
- Quantify where possible; use ranges if exact values are unavailable.
- Add confidence level (`High/Med/Low`) with one-line justification in major sections.
- Keep all key claims auditable via `Evidence Pack` source tags.
- Use exact section headers from `FORMAT`; do not add extra sections.
- Depth handling:
  - `Brief`: cap around 600 words total.
  - `Standard`: normal detail.
  - `Deep`: expanded sub-bullets and richer tables.
- Include required tables:
  - Capabilities Heatmap,
  - Likely Moves Matrix,
  - Counter-Moves Plan.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

1. Executive Snapshot (<=120 words)

2. Objectives (Future Goals)

3. Current Strategy

4. Assumptions

5. Capabilities (Resources & Weaknesses)

Capabilities Heatmap
| Capability | Rating (High/Medium/Low) | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R&D |  |  |
| Cost position |  |  |
| Brand |  |  |
| Data assets |  |  |
| Channel strength |  |  |
| Supply chain |  |  |
| Regulatory savvy |  |  |
| Hiring velocity |  |  |

6. Likely Moves & Response Profile

Likely Moves Matrix
| Move | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Earliest timing | Leading indicators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

7. Implications for Us

Counter-Moves Plan
| Our move | Objective | Dependency | Owner | T-minus signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |

8. Evidence Pack
- [S1] [Source title] ([Date])
- [S2] [Source title] ([Date])

9. Unknowns & Validation Plan

10. Appendix
- KPI table: [price levels, feature parity, share estimates, CAC/LTV clues if available]
- Timeline of notable moves (last 12-24 months)

FAILURE
- Any required section header/table from `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or materially incomplete.
- One or more core model components (Objectives/Current Strategy/Assumptions/Capabilities) lacks concrete, testable claims.
- Likely moves are not logically connected to the four core model components.
- Key claims lack `[S#]` references to `Evidence Pack`.
- Confidence levels are missing in major sections.
- `DESIRED_DEPTH=Brief` output is materially overlong.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
