INPUTS

- {{CUSTOMER_NOTES}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Solution anti-patterns from customer problem analysis.
Success metric:
- Produces exactly 3 plausible but fundamentally flawed solutions derived from the customer problem context.
- Each flawed solution is clearly mapped to why it fails (or worsens outcomes) with concrete evidence from inputs.
- Output follows the required schema exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `{{CUSTOMER_NOTES}}`; if details are missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Analyze first, then propose flawed solutions; do not skip analysis steps.
- Keep flaws subtle and realistic (not absurd/comedic), and tie them to customer context.
- Ensure each flawed solution is implementable on the surface but strategically wrong.
- Cover short-term and long-term consequences, stakeholder impacts, and implementation constraints.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<problem_analysis>
1. Notes breakdown: [Key points, assumptions, implicit needs]
2. Core problems: [Primary problems to address]
3. Stakeholders: [Stakeholder -> interests]
4. Failure-prone areas: [Where solutions can go wrong]
5. Consequences: [Short-term and long-term consequences to watch]
6. Constraints: [Resource and implementation constraints]
7. Flawed-approach brainstorm: [Candidate anti-pattern directions]
</problem_analysis>

<bad_solutions>
1. [Brief description of flawed solution 1]
2. [Brief description of flawed solution 2]
3. [Brief description of flawed solution 3]
</bad_solutions>

<explanations>
1. [Why solution 1 is a poor choice: misread need, hidden downside, likely failure mode, consequence]
2. [Why solution 2 is a poor choice: misread need, hidden downside, likely failure mode, consequence]
3. [Why solution 3 is a poor choice: misread need, hidden downside, likely failure mode, consequence]
</explanations>

FAILURE
- Any required section in `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Not exactly 3 flawed solutions.
- Explanations do not map 1:1 to the listed solutions.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Flaws are absurd/comedic instead of plausible and subtle.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
