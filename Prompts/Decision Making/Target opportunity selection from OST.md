INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{BUSINESS_OUTCOME}}
- {{JOURNEY_NODES_AS_LIST}}
- {{INTERVIEW_TRANSCRIPTS_OR_STORY_SNIPPETS}}
- {{CONSTRAINTS_OR_PRINCIPLES}}
- {{OST_JSON}}
- Optional: {{WEIGHTS_JSON}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: "Target opportunity selection from OST".
Success metric:
- Recommends exactly one small, distinct, moment-scoped target opportunity from the OST.
- Uses evidence-grounded scoring across Opportunity, Market, Company, and Customer factors.
- Produces a shortlist and recommendation that are traceable to OST/interview evidence.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs; if a required field is missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Candidate harvesting:
  - From `{{OST_JSON}}`, include leaf opportunities plus intermediate parents with 2+ specific children or explicit traceability evidence.
  - Merge duplicates and reframe solution-framed items as opportunity/need statements.
- Score each candidate 1-5 on:
  - Opportunity Sizing (OS), Market Factors (MF), Company Factors (CF), Customer Factors (CuF).
- Compute WPS with default weights unless `{{WEIGHTS_JSON}}` is provided and sums to 1.0:
  - Default weights: OS 0.35, MF 0.20, CF 0.25, CuF 0.20.
- If factor data is missing, assign score `3` and flag as low evidence.
- Shortlist top 3-5 by WPS, then apply tie-breakers in order:
  - distinctness (thinner slice), evidence quality, time-to-learning, risk diversification across moments.
- Recommend exactly one target opportunity that is small, distinct, moment-scoped, and independently addressable.
- Do not include solution effort or engineering feasibility estimates at this stage.
- Maintain traceability to interview/OST evidence and avoid exposing PII not present in inputs.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

Part A - Candidate Inventory (from OST)
| id | moment | opportunity | level (leaf/parent) | distinct_from | evidence_summary | notes |
| -- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
[`evidence_summary` must include: `{frequency_count, confidence, #quotes}` with 1-2 short quote snippets.]

Part B - Scoring Matrix
| id | OS (weight) | MF (weight) | CF (weight) | CuF (weight) | WPS | factor_rationales |
| -- | ----------: | ----------: | ----------: | -----------: | --: | ----------------- |
[Use 1-5 integers for factor scores and show WPS calculation basis.]

Part C - Shortlist (Top 3-5)
- [id] - [1-2 sentence justification]
- [id] - [1-2 sentence justification]
- [id] - [1-2 sentence justification]
[Optional 4th/5th item]

Part D - Recommendation (One Target Opportunity)
- Selected id & title: [id] - [opportunity]
- Why now:
  - [3-5 evidence-grounded bullets]
- Scope check:
  - [Confirm small distinct slice tied to one moment and independent from siblings]
- Risks/Unknowns:
  - [Bullets]
- Immediate next steps:
  - Generate 3 competing solution ideas for this opportunity.
  - Draft assumption map (desirability, usability, feasibility, viability, ethical).
  - Design smallest tests for riskiest assumptions with success criteria.

Part E - Audit (Torres Alignment)
- No-effort policy honored? [yes/no + explanation]
- Moment distinctness verified? [yes/no + overlaps if any]
- Evidence gaps requiring quick follow-up interview or data pull: [Bullets]

FAILURE
- Any required part/table/list item from `FORMAT` is missing or materially incomplete.
- Fewer than 3 or more than 5 shortlisted opportunities.
- Recommendation is not exactly one opportunity.
- Scoring is missing factor scores, WPS, or weight usage.
- Tie-break logic is not applied when close/top candidates conflict.
- Output includes effort/engineering-feasibility prioritization.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
