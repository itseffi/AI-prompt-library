INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- [No explicit variables declared; use provided context.]
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a complete, executive-ready AI Recommendation Canvas for a specific problem/persona, plus improvement suggestions and a go/no-go decision.
Success metric:
- Canvas is coherent, measurable, and defensible across business outcome, product outcome, solution hypothesis, and success metrics.
- Unknowns are explicitly marked; no invented facts.
- Includes 3-5 concrete improvement suggestions and a clear go/no-go recommendation.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required workflow:
  1. Gather/normalize available context and identify missing critical inputs.
  2. Tighten outcomes into SMART form.
  3. Build the canvas with explicit unknowns and assumptions.
  4. Add 3-5 improvement suggestions.
  5. Provide a go/no-go recommendation with rationale.
- If multiple personas exist, choose one primary persona and note secondary impacts.
- For regulated data, include compliance and data-minimization constraints.
- For generative AI use cases, include safety/evaluation/abuse-monitoring considerations.
- Distinguish risks to investigate (pre-decision) vs risks to monitor (post-decision).
- Keep language concise, outcome-first, and metric-linked.
- Do not invent facts; mark unknowns explicitly.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

FAILURE
- Canvas is not rendered as a single Markdown code block.
- Required canvas sections are missing or materially incomplete.
- Missing `<review>` section with 3-5 suggestions.
