</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: "Competitive parity and strategic differentiation".
Success metric:
- Produces a clear parity-vs-differentiation decision grounded in competitive context and product strategy.
- Distinguishes table-stakes matching from strategic differentiation, leapfrogging, or deliberate skipping.
- Provides actionable implementation guidance and monitoring signals tied to the recommendation.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `{{COMPETITIVE_FEATURE}}`, `{{COMPETITOR_CONTEXT}}`, and `{{OUR_PRODUCT_STRATEGY}}`; if information is missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Analyze competitor capability, UX, target users/use cases, and positioning before recommending action.
- Classify strategic importance as one of: Table Stakes, Valuable Differentiator, Non-Essential, Strategic Distraction.
- Evaluate four paths: do better, do differently, leapfrog, skip.
- Frame decisions as strategy-led (serving our users and positioning), not reactive feature copying.
- Include user/market implications, recommendation rationale, implementation guidance, and ongoing monitoring metrics/signals.
- Keep claims specific and evidence-oriented; avoid generic statements.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<competitive_feature_analysis>
**What Competitor Built:**  
[Describe capabilities and UX approach]

**Why They Built It:**  
[Infer strategic intent: what user need, what market position, what business goal]

**Who It Serves:**  
[Target users and use cases]

**How They Positioned It:**  
[Marketing/messaging angle]

**Market Reception:**  
[If known: user feedback, adoption, impact]

<strategic_importance_assessment>
**Classification:**  
[Select one: Table Stakes / Valuable Differentiator / Non-Essential / Strategic Distraction]

**Rationale:**  
[Explain the classification]

**Evidence:**
