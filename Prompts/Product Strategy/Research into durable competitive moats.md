GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Research into durable competitive moats.
Success metric:
- Produces research-grounded moat insights and converts them into implementation-ready strategies.
- Delivers a diversified moat portfolio with explicit probabilities, defensibility, and kill criteria.
- Keeps recommendations constrained by feasibility, compounding potential, and non-copyability.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `{{APP_CONTEXT}}` and `{{RESEARCH_BUNDLE}}`; if critical info is missing, add explicit assumptions in a top-level `assumptions` array.
- Extract 8-15 research-backed insights; each insight must include:
  - `id` (e.g., `I1`),
  - `insight` (one sentence),
  - `evidence` (quote/paraphrase + source cue),
  - `implication` (competitive implication).
- Generate `k` moat strategies (`k={{K_STRATEGIES}}` if provided; otherwise 10).
- Allowed `moat_type` values:
  - `data moat`, `network effects`, `switching costs`, `distribution moat`, `brand`, `scale economies`, `ecosystem/platform`, `regulatory/permissions`, `IP/know-how`, `community`.
- Each strategy must include:
  - `title`,
  - `moat_type`,
  - `contrarian` (boolean),
  - `mechanism`,
  - `research_link` (insight IDs),
  - `implementation_plan` (`now_30d`, `next_90d`, `next_12m`, each 3-6 steps),
  - `prerequisites`,
  - `metrics` (3-6 leading indicators with targets),
  - `risks_and_mitigations` (3-6),
  - `time_to_moat` (`<3 months`, `3-6 months`, `6-12 months`, `12-24 months`, `24+ months`),
  - `estimated_cost` (`low`, `medium`, `high`),
  - `defensibility_score` (1-10) and `defensibility_justification`,
  - `probability` (decimal 0.0-1.0).
- Diversity constraints:
  - every strategy probability `< 0.15`,
  - at least 3 strategies with probability `< 0.07`,
  - no `moat_type` used more than twice,
  - at least 2 strategies with `contrarian=true`.
- Portfolio section must include:
  - `recommended_portfolio` (exactly 3 strategies with rationale),
  - `kill_criteria` (2-3 falsifiable stop criteria per recommended strategy),
  - `sequencing` (month-by-month plan for 6 months with dependencies).
- Output must be valid JSON only, concise and implementation-ready.

FAILURE
- Output is not valid JSON.
- Required top-level keys are missing or malformed.
- Insight count is outside 8-15.
- Strategy count does not equal `k` (default 10).
- Any strategy misses required fields or contains invalid enum values.
- Distribution constraints are violated (probability caps, low-probability count, moat-type repetition, contrarian minimum).
- `recommended_portfolio` does not contain exactly 3 strategies.
- Kill criteria are not falsifiable or have fewer than 2 criteria per recommended strategy.
- Sequencing is not month-by-month for 6 months.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
