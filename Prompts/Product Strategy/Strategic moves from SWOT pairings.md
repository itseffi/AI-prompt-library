GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Strategic moves from SWOT pairings.
Success metric:
- Produces strategic move patterns for all 6 SWOT pairings.
- Includes a combination matrix and 3–7 unifying strategic themes.
- Keeps patterns general (not hyper-specific tactics) unless explicitly requested.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided SWOT inputs; if context is missing, ask a short set of clarification questions first.
- Generate patterns for all 6 SWOT pairings.
- Provide 5–10 patterns per pairing, each with an optional trigger and a risk/assumption note.
- Include a combination matrix and 3–7 strategic themes.
- Keep output general unless the user explicitly requests company-specific tactics.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<clarifying_questions>
[If needed: ask up to 6 concise questions to obtain missing context and SWOT lists]
</clarifying_questions>

<swot_pairings>
<so_growth_leverage>
1. [Pattern] - Trigger: [If/then] - Risk/Assumption: [Note]
...
</so_growth_leverage>

<st_defensive_advantage>
1. [Pattern] - Trigger: [If/then] - Risk/Assumption: [Note]
...
</st_defensive_advantage>

<wo_capability_building>
1. [Pattern] - Trigger: [If/then] - Risk/Assumption: [Note]

<ot_market_shaping>

<combination_matrix>
[Lightweight matching rules across SWOT items]
</combination_matrix>

<strategic_themes>
1. [Theme]
2. [Theme]
3. [Theme]
[Up to 7 themes]
</strategic_themes>

FAILURE
- Any required section/tag in `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Any SWOT pairing has fewer than 5 or more than 10 patterns.
- Combination matrix or strategic themes are missing.
- Patterns are overly tactic-specific without request.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
