GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Low-Frequency-to-Power-User Transition Strategy.
Success metric:
- Produces a concrete transition plan from low-frequency to high-frequency usage.
- Aligns strategy to current and target use cases with explicit behavioral gaps.
- Includes metrics, timeline, and rollout/education plans grounded in the inputs.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `{{PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION}}`, `{{CURRENT_USE_CASE}}`, and `{{TARGET_USE_CASE}}`; if information is missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Identify the behavioral gap between current and target usage.
- Provide step-by-step transition plan, education/onboarding, and communication strategy.
- Include rollout plan, key metrics, and timeline for measurement.
- Keep recommendations specific and grounded in the provided context.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<transition_strategy>
1. Current Use Case Analysis:
   [Provide a brief analysis of the current low-frequency use case]

2. Target Use Case Analysis:
   [Provide a brief analysis of the target high-frequency use case]

3. User Behavior and Needs:
   [Summarize key insights about user behavior and needs]

4. Transition Strategy:
   a. Feature Introduction Plan:
      [Outline the step-by-step plan for introducing new features]
   b. User Education and Onboarding:
      [Describe the approach for educating users about the new use case]
   c. Communication Strategy:
      [Outline the key messages and channels for communicating the benefits]
   d. Gradual Rollout Plan:
      [Describe the approach for gradually introducing new functionality]

5. Implementation and Measurement:
   a. Key Metrics:
      [List the primary metrics to track for measuring success]
   b. Timeline:
      [Provide a high-level timeline for implementation and evaluation]
   c. Feedback and Iteration:
      [Describe the plan for collecting user feedback and making improvements]

6. Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:
   [Identify potential obstacles and propose solutions]

7. Conclusion:
   [Summarize the key points of the transition strategy and its potential impact]

FAILURE
- Any required section/tag in `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Behavioral gap or barriers are not explicitly identified.
- Metrics or timeline are missing.
- Strategies are generic or not tied to the given use cases.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
