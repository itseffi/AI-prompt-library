<decision_frameworks>
## Daily Design Decision Criteria

[Questions to ask when making design choices to ensure vision alignment]

### When Choosing Between Design Alternatives

1. **Vision alignment check:** Which option better advances strategic themes [list themes]?
   - Option A: [How it aligns or conflicts]
   - Option B: [How it aligns or conflicts]
   - Winner: [Which to choose and why]

2. **Scalability evaluation:** Which option extends to future use cases implied by vision?
   - Consider: [Upcoming features or use cases]
   - Test: [Can this pattern handle those scenarios?]

3. **Consistency assessment:** Which option reinforces established patterns vs. introducing divergence?
   - If new pattern is needed: [Justify with strategic rationale]
   - If consistency conflicts with vision: [Escalate or document tradeoff]

4. **User value prioritization:** Which option prioritizes user needs over internal convenience?
   - Red flag: [Designs optimized for engineering simplicity or business politics over UX]

5. **Technical feasibility reality check:** Is this implementable within constraints?
   - If not: [Adjust design or advocate for constraint removal]
   - If workaround needed: [Ensure workaround doesn't degrade UX]

### When Vision and Immediate Needs Conflict

**Favor vision if:**
- Immediate need is temporary or can be solved another way
- Vision direction is high-confidence and well-validated
- Technical debt from immediate solution is significant

**Favor immediate need if:**
- Blocker for users or business (not just internal inconvenience)
- Vision direction is uncertain or likely to change
- Can be implemented without major technical debt

**Seek creative middle ground:**
- Phased rollout (simple now, vision-aligned later)
- Feature flags (ship both, test and learn)
- Modular design (immediate solution doesn't preclude vision path)

**Escalate when:**
- Tradeoff has significant strategic implications
- Decision affects multiple teams or long-term architecture
- Stakeholder alignment is needed

### Pattern Establishment vs. Deferral

**Standardize now if:**
- Pattern will be used in 3+ places imminently
- Consistency is critical for usability (e.g., error handling, form validation)
- Foundation for other patterns (e.g., base components)

**Defer standardization if:**
- Single-use or rare use case
- Vision direction unclear and pattern may change
- Pattern is experimental and needs validation first

**Create flexible pattern if:**
- Vision direction uncertain but action needed now
- Multiple future variations likely
- Learning required before locking in specific implementation

### Scope Management

**When new requests arise outside quarterly plan:**

1. **Does this directly advance a Q1 vision element?**
   - Yes → Evaluate against current priorities
   - No → Default to defer unless exception criteria met

2. **Exception criteria:**
   - Critical user blocker (cannot accomplish core tasks)
   - Regulatory or legal requirement
   - Foundational for Q2+ work (pull forward)
   - Opportunistic (very low effort, high strategic value)

3. **If considering inclusion, ask: What would we deprioritize?**
   - Evaluate tradeoff explicitly
   - Ensure swapped item is truly lower priority
   - Get stakeholder alignment on change

4. **Can this be achieved with existing patterns?**
   - Yes → Lower cost, more likely to include
   - No → Higher bar for inclusion
