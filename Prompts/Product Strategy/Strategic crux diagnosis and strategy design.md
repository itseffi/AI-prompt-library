GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Strategic crux diagnosis and strategy design.
Success metric:
- Identifies the strategic crux with evidence-backed rationale.
- Proposes a leveraged strategy with explicit trade-offs and testable milestones.
- Provides a concrete execution plan with experiments, metrics, and risks.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs; if critical items are missing, ask up to 6 concise clarification questions first.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and inferences; label disconfirming evidence and uncertainties.
- Identify the crux and choose a leveraged strategy with explicit trade-offs.
- Provide options table, chosen strategy, 12–18 week moves, experiments, metrics, risks, and resources.
- If constraints make the goal infeasible, propose renegotiations with quantified trade-offs.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

1) Executive Summary (<=200 words)

2) Strategic Narrative

3) Evidence Pack

4) Crux Definition

5) Options & Trade-offs
| Option | Core Bet | Expected Impact (with math) | Cost (money/teams) | Time-to-First-Signal | Risks | Reversibility | Why It Might Fail |

6) Chosen Strategy (Leverage Thesis)

7) Strategic Moves (12–18 weeks)
| Move | Owner | Start | End | Dependencies | Weekly Leading Indicator | Target | Risk & Mitigation |

8) Experiments to Prove/Disprove

9) Metrics & Monitoring

10) Risks, Preconditions, and Constraint Renegotiations

11) Resource Plan

12) Decision Log & Next Checkpoint

Appendices (tables)
1. Assumptions -> Tests Map: | Assumption | Test/Experiment | When | Owner | Decision Rule |
2. Roadmap (Quarter): | Week | Move | Deliverable | Confidence |
3. Stakeholder Map: | Stakeholder | Interest/Influence | What They Need to See |

FAILURE
- Any required section/table in `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Crux is not explicitly defined or not tied to evidence.
- Options table is missing or lacks required columns.
- Moves lack owners, timeline, or leading indicators.
- Experiments lack hypothesis/metrics or stop/scale rules.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
