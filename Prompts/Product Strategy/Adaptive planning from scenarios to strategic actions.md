GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Adaptive planning from scenarios to strategic actions.
Success metric:
- Produces a complete four-quadrant analysis and feedback loop grounded in the provided scenarios.
- Identifies concrete adjustments and capabilities to avoid the projected mess and enable the ideal future.
- Ends with a concise, actionable plan with specific next steps.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `{{CURRENT_STATE}}`, `{{PROJECTED_MESS}}`, `{{IDEAL_FUTURE}}`, and `{{IDEAL_CURRENT_STATE}}`; if missing data is critical, state assumptions explicitly.
- Address all four quadrants and the feedback loop, grounded in provided inputs.
- Keep analysis specific and actionable; avoid generic leadership or capability lists.
- Action plan must include concrete steps that bridge current to ideal while mitigating projected mess.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<adaptive_planning_analysis>
<quadrant_1_analysis>
[Your analysis of the Current State]
</quadrant_1_analysis>

<quadrant_2_analysis>
[Your analysis of the Projected Mess]
</quadrant_2_analysis>

<quadrant_3_analysis>
[Your analysis of the Ideal Future]
</quadrant_3_analysis>

<quadrant_4_analysis>
[Your analysis of the Ideal Current State]
</quadrant_4_analysis>

<feedback_loop_analysis>
<current_state_adjustments>
[Your recommendations for current state adjustments]
</current_state_adjustments>

<avoiding_projected_mess>
[Your recommendations for avoiding the projected mess]
</avoiding_projected_mess>

<enabling_ideal_future>
[Your recommendations for enabling the ideal future]
</enabling_ideal_future>
</feedback_loop_analysis>

<summary_and_action_plan>
[Your concise summary and specific, actionable steps]
</summary_and_action_plan>
</adaptive_planning_analysis>

FAILURE
- Any required section/tag in `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Feedback loop omits one of the three adjustment categories.
- Action plan lacks concrete, actionable steps linked to the quadrants.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
