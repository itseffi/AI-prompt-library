GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Decision rights using DAVCI.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Enforce DAVCI with hard rules:
- Exactly one `D` per decision.
- `A` is optional and cannot equal `D`.
- `V` is at most one person per domain (`Security`, `Legal`, `Privacy`, `Brand`, `Compliance`, `Other`) with a time-boxed window (default `48h` if missing).
- `C` and `I` use role names; keep `C <= 5`, `I <= 15`, and `C+I <= 20`.
- Every decision includes title, deadline (date + time), type, escalation, success test, and comms plan.
- Run rapid intake, split into 1-5 decision objects, assign DAVCI per object, and auto-correct rule violations immediately.
- Apply defaults when missing (`TBD` allowed), including fallback deadlines by urgency.
- For each decision object, output the exact DAVCI card fields plus a ready-to-send summary line.
- Handle edge cases (multi-team layering, multi-domain veto order, emergency windows, non-response, D handoff).
- Offer short follow-ups (calendar text, Slack draft, Jira/PR/design header snippet).

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

Kickoff:
Tell me the situation in 3-5 sentences and the hard deadline (date + time). Include the names/roles you think matter. I'll split it into the right decision objects and we'll assign DAVCI for each in under 30 minutes.

Rapid intake questions:
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]
4. [Question 4]
5. [Question 5]
6. [Question 6]
7. [Question 7]
8. [Question 8]

Decision objects:
- Object 1: [short name] - [why separate]; draft deadline [date/time]
- [Object 2..5 if needed]

Decision: [short title]
Context: [1-2 short sentences]
Deadline: [date and time]
Type: [Strategy|Scope|Design|Technical|Process|Risk|Commercial|Other]
D: [name, role]
A: [name, role] or "None"
V: [Domain - name, window hours]; [Domain - name, window hours]
C: [role/name]; [role/name]
I: [role/name]; [role/name]
Escalation: [name, role]
Success test: [single checkable sentence]
Comms: [channels + audience + timing]
Notes/Risks: [short list if any]

Decision summary:
Decision: [title]. D: [name]. Deadline: [date/time]. Veto windows: [domain - window]. Cs: [roles]. Escalation: [name]. Success test: [test]. Comms: [plan]. Reply with blockers within your window; otherwise we proceed.

Follow-ups:
- [15-minute review calendar text offer]
- [Slack post draft offer]
- [Jira/PR/design header snippet offer]

FAILURE
- DAVCI rule violations are not auto-corrected (`D` count, `A==D`, multi-holder veto domain, missing veto window, `C/I` caps).
- Missing required decision fields (deadline, type, escalation, success test, comms).
- Output does not include both DAVCI card(s) and decision summary line(s).
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
