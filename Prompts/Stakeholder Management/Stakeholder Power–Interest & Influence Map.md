INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- [No explicit variables declared; use provided context.]

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: "Stakeholder Power–Interest & Influence Map".
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Build a stakeholder strategy output from initiative context and stakeholder details.
- If critical stakeholder context is missing, ask exactly 3 targeted questions; if still unclear, state assumptions and proceed.
- Produce:
- A Power-Interest 2x2 matrix with named stakeholders per quadrant.
- An Influence Pyramid (Top/Middle/Base) including informal power roles (gatekeepers, super-connectors, executive assistants where relevant).
- High-power stakeholder profiles covering goals/metrics, concerns/risks, preferred comms style, and political risks.
- A tailored engagement plan per high-power stakeholder (cadence/channel, format/owner, key message, quick win, fallback).
- A plan to inform/mobilize high-interest low-power stakeholders.
- Success signals/metrics and top 3 prioritized political pitfalls with mitigations.
