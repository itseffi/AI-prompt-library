INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{EXEC_FEEDBACK}}
- {{CURRENT_DESIGN_CONTEXT}}
- {{PROJECT_BACKGROUND}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Exec feedback without context to actionable design requirements.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Decode `{{EXEC_FEEDBACK}}` into actionable design intent using `{{CURRENT_DESIGN_CONTEXT}}` and `{{PROJECT_BACKGROUND}}`.
- Distinguish concern, desired outcome, feedback type, and whether it is a requirement vs preference.
- Identify missing context required to execute.
- Produce 2-3 concrete interpretations with "done" criteria, implications, effort, and likelihood.
- Provide clarifying questions covering intent, priority, success, and data.
- Propose interim next steps and a respectful communication plan aligned to executive intent.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<executive_feedback_structure>
<feedback_decoding>
<expressed_concern>
[What problem or opportunity is the executive highlighting?]
</expressed_concern>

<desired_outcome>
[What result is the executive hoping to achieve?]
</desired_outcome>

<feedback_type>
[Classify as: Strategic direction, Quality concern, Risk mitigation, User impact, Personal preference, or Unclear]
</feedback_type>

<requirement_or_preference>
[Assess whether this is:
- Must-have requirement (blocks launch without it)
- Important improvement (should address if feasible)
- Nice-to-have suggestion (consider if time permits)
- Personal preference (may or may not be valid concern)]
</requirement_or_preference>
</feedback_decoding>

<missing_context>
[List specific context needed to action the feedback:
- What defines success for addressing this?
- What are the constraints?
- How urgent/important is this?
- Who has final decision authority?
- When does this need to be resolved?
- What data would inform the decision?]
</missing_context>

<possible_interpretations>
<interpretation_1>
**What This Could Mean:**
[Specific interpretation of the feedback]

**If This Is The Intent, "Done" Looks Like:**
[Concrete, testable criteria for addressing the feedback]

**Design Implications:**
[Specific design changes that would address this interpretation]

**Effort Required:**
[Time/complexity to implement]

**Likelihood:**
[High/Medium/Low based on context]
</interpretation_1>

<interpretation_2>
**What This Could Mean:**
[Alternative specific interpretation]

**If This Is The Intent, "Done" Looks Like:**
[Concrete, testable criteria]

**Design Implications:**
[Specific design changes]

**Effort Required:**
[Time/complexity]

**Likelihood:**
[High/Medium/Low]
</interpretation_2>

<interpretation_3>
**What This Could Mean:**
[Third possible interpretation, if applicable]

**If This Is The Intent, "Done" Looks Like:**
[Concrete, testable criteria]

**Design Implications:**
[Specific design changes]

**Effort Required:**
[Time/complexity]

**Likelihood:**
[High/Medium/Low]
</interpretation_3>
</possible_interpretations>

<clarifying_questions>
<intent_questions>
[Questions to uncover what the executive really wants:
- Example: "When you mentioned X, were you concerned about Y or Z?"]
</intent_questions>

<priority_questions>
[Questions to establish importance:
- Example: "Is this a must-have for launch, or something we should address post-launch?"]
</priority_questions>

<success_questions>
[Questions to define acceptance criteria:
- Example: "What would you need to see to feel confident this concern is addressed?"]
</success_questions>

<data_questions>
[Questions to gather validation data:
- Example: "Would you like to see user research on this, or is this based on strategic direction?"]
</data_questions>
</clarifying_questions>

<interim_next_steps>
[Propose actions that make progress while awaiting clarification:
- Research options for addressing concern
- Create low-fidelity explorations of different interpretations
- Gather data that would inform the decision
- Identify quick wins that address concern partially
- Document implications of different approaches]
</interim_next_steps>

<communication_plan>
**Recommended Approach for Follow-up:**
[Describe how to engage the executive to get needed clarity:
- When to reach out (immediately vs. wait for next check-in)
- How to frame the conversation (focus on outcomes, show options)
- What to prepare (mockups, data, tradeoff analysis)
- Who else should be involved]

**Draft Message:**
[Provide a template message requesting clarification that:
- Acknowledges the feedback
- Shows you've thought about it
- Presents interpretations
- Requests specific input
- Proposes next steps]
</communication_plan>
</executive_feedback_structure>

FAILURE
- Any required section in `<executive_feedback_structure>` is missing or materially incomplete.
- Interpretations are generic, non-testable, or not grounded in provided context.
- Clarifying questions fail to cover intent, priority, success, and data.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
