INPUTS

- {{VAGUE_BRIEF}}
- {{STAKEHOLDER_CONTEXT}}
- {{BUSINESS_CONSTRAINTS}}
- {{USER_RESEARCH}}
- {{CURRENT_METRICS}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Stakeholder Brief Clarification and Problem Definition.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Transform `{{VAGUE_BRIEF}}` into a concrete, measurable problem definition using `{{STAKEHOLDER_CONTEXT}}`, `{{BUSINESS_CONSTRAINTS}}`, `{{USER_RESEARCH}}`, and `{{CURRENT_METRICS}}`.
- Decode subjective language, assumptions, implied intent, symptom vs root cause, and solution bias.
- Extract business drivers, user problems, and concrete success criteria.
- Translate vague terms into observable/measurable design criteria.
- Identify technical, timeline, budget, brand/design, and organizational constraints.
- Generate validation-oriented clarifying questions and actionable next steps.
- Keep analysis objective, evidence-based, and explicit about assumptions and unknowns.

**Translation of "[VAGUE_TERM_2]":**
- Criterion 1: [specific, measurable attribute]

<success_metrics>
**Primary Success Metric:**
- Metric: [specific measurement]
- Current baseline: [X]

<refined_problem_statement>
**Problem Statement:**
We need to [specific design action] for [specific user segment] so that [specific user outcome] and [specific business outcome], as measured by [primary metric] improving from [baseline] to [target] by [date], while considering [key constraints].

**In Plain Language:**
[Restate the problem statement in conversational terms that any stakeholder can understand]

**Scope Boundaries:**
- In scope: [what this problem statement includes]
- Out of scope: [what this explicitly does not include]
- Future consideration: [what might be addressed later]
</refined_problem_statement>

<validation_questions>
**Business Outcome Validation:**
1. What would represent a home-run outcome for this initiative in 6 months?
2. If we could only improve one business metric, which would matter most?
3. What would cause you to consider this effort a failure, even if users liked it?

**User Need Validation:**
4. Which user segment would benefit most from solving this problem?
5. How do we know users actually experience this as a problem vs. our assumption?
6. What would users give up or trade off to get this improvement?

**Scope and Priority Validation:**
7. If we had to cut scope by 50%, what's the core of this request we must keep?
8. What's more important: shipping by [date] or achieving [specific outcome]?
9. How does this compare in priority to [other initiative on roadmap]?

**Constraints Validation:**
10. What technical limitations should we absolutely not try to work around?
11. Are there brand or design standards we could flex if it meant better user outcomes?
12. What budget or timeline assumptions should we validate before proceeding?

**Success Criteria Validation:**
13. How will we know if we've succeeded in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?
14. What user feedback or behavior would make you confident we solved this?
15. What business metrics matter more than hitting the launch date?
</validation_questions>

<recommended_next_steps>
1. **Validate assumptions:** [Specific research or conversations needed to confirm problem understanding]
2. **Baseline metrics:** [Establish current measurements for success criteria]
3. **Exploratory design:** [Create lightweight concepts to test problem framing]
4. **Stakeholder alignment:** [Schedule review of refined problem statement with key stakeholders]
5. **Technical feasibility:** [Partner with engineering to validate constraints and opportunities]
6. **User validation:** [Test problem statement against actual user pain points through interviews or surveys]
7. **Prioritization:** [Compare this problem statement against other roadmap items]

</problem_statement_analysis>

FAILURE
- Any required section in `<problem_statement_analysis>` is missing or materially incomplete.
- Problem statement is not measurable (missing baseline/target/date/constraints).
- Clarifying questions are not actionable or do not address business, user, scope, constraints, and success validation.
- Metrics and constraints are generic or not traceable to the provided inputs.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
