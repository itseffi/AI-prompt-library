INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{CONFLICTING_REQUIREMENTS}}
- {{STAKEHOLDER_PRIORITIES}}
- {{PROJECT_CONTEXT}}
- {{USER_RESEARCH_INSIGHTS}}
- {{TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Conflicting stakeholder requirements to balanced design approach.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Reconcile `{{CONFLICTING_REQUIREMENTS}}` using `{{STAKEHOLDER_PRIORITIES}}`, `{{PROJECT_CONTEXT}}`, `{{USER_RESEARCH_INSIGHTS}}`, and `{{TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS}}`.
- Map conflict types, stakeholder positions, severity, and dependencies.
- Identify root causes, then propose win-win solutions and explicit tradeoffs.
- Provide a recommendation with rationale, decision framework, communication plan, and validation plan.
