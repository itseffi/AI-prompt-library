3. [Action - e.g., "Conduct user research on current pain points"]
</executive_summary>

<explicit_constraints>
## User Needs

**Primary User Goal:** [What users are trying to accomplish]

**Specific User Needs:**
1. [User need] - [Why this matters]
   - Example: "Complete tax filing in under 30 minutes" - Users are time-constrained, will abandon if too complex
2. [User need] - [Why this matters]
3. [User need] - [Why this matters]

**Jobs-to-be-Done:**
- When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]
- Example: "When filing my taxes, I want to quickly import my W-2 data, so I can avoid manual data entry errors"

**User Context:**
- **Technical proficiency:** [Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced]
- **Device usage:** [Mobile-first / Desktop-primary / Mixed]
- **Usage frequency:** [Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Annually]
- **Context of use:** [On-the-go / At desk / High-stress / Time-constrained]

**Design Implications:**
- [How user needs translate to design requirements]
- Example: "Users are time-constrained → Design for speed (autofill, smart defaults, minimal steps)"

---

**Data Constraints:**
- **Data availability:** [What data is available in real-time vs. cached?]
- **Data format:** [JSON, XML, etc.]
- **Data limitations:** [Rate limits, data freshness, completeness]

**Design Implications:**
- [How technical constraints affect design]
- Example: "Offline support required → Design for sync states (loading, synced, sync failed), indicate what works offline"

---

## Business Requirements

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- [Regulation] - [Specific requirements]
  - Example: "GDPR - Must collect explicit consent for data processing, provide data export/deletion"
  - Example: "WCAG 2.1 AA - Must meet accessibility standards (color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)"

**Business Logic:**
- [Business rule] - [How it affects design]
  - Example: "Free trial users can access features A, B, C but not D, E - Must clearly indicate locked features"
  - Example: "Approval workflow requires manager sign-off for purchases >$1000 - Design approval flow with notifications"

**Monetization Requirements:**
- [Requirement] - [Design implications]
  - Example: "Freemium model with paywall after 3 exports - Design paywall that clearly communicates value of upgrade"
  - Example: "Ads on free tier - Design ad placements that don't disrupt core user flow"

- **Dependencies:** [What are we waiting on? Other teams, external vendors?]

**Design Implications:**
- [How timeline/resources affect scope]
- Example: "6 weeks to design + 4 weeks to build → Focus on MVP, defer nice-to-haves to v2"

---

## Scope Requirements

**Must-Have (MVP Features):**
- [Feature] - [Why it's must-have]
  - Example: "Credit card payment support - Cannot launch e-commerce without ability to collect payment"

**Should-Have (Important but not blocking):**

  - Example: "Saved payment methods - Improves returning user experience, but first-time users can still checkout"

**Could-Have (Nice-to-have if time allows):**
- [Feature] - [Why it's nice-to-have]
  - Example: "Gift wrapping option - Adds value but low usage expected"

**Won't-Have (Explicitly out of scope):**
- [Feature] - [Why we're not doing it]
  - Example: "Cryptocurrency payments - Too few users, high implementation complexity, defer to v2"

**Design Implications:**
- [How scope affects design priorities]
- Example: "MVP focused → Design core flow excellently, cut secondary features"

</explicit_constraints>

<implicit_constraints>
## Platform Conventions

[List platform-specific conventions that should be followed even if not explicitly stated]

**iOS:**
- Navigation bar at top, tab bar at bottom
- System fonts (San Francisco) and standard UI components
- Standard gestures (swipe back, pull to refresh)
- Haptic feedback for key interactions

**Android:**
- Material Design principles (FAB, bottom sheets)
- System back button behavior
- Material motion and elevation system

**Web:**
- Underlined links or clear visual distinction
- Breadcrumbs for deep hierarchy
- Search in header (typically top-right)
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)

**Design Implication:** "Follow platform conventions to meet user expectations, don't reinvent standard patterns"

---

## Existing Patterns Users Expect

**Product-Specific Patterns:**
- [Pattern already established in our product]
- Example: "We always use bottom sheet for secondary actions - maintain consistency"

**Industry Conventions:**
- [Pattern users know from competitor products]
- Example: "E-commerce checkout follows: Cart → Shipping → Payment → Review → Confirmation"

**Design Implication:** "Leverage existing mental models, don't make users learn new patterns unnecessarily"

---

## Performance Expectations (Unstated)

- **Page load:** Users expect <3 seconds, abandon after 5 seconds
- **Interaction responsiveness:** Buttons/links respond <100ms (feels instant)
- **Animation:** 60fps for smooth motion (30fps feels janky)
- **Search results:** Return results <1 second (ideally instant)

**Design Implication:** "Design with performance in mind - minimize heavy assets, use lazy loading, show loading states"

---

## Accessibility Requirements (Often Assumed)

- **WCAG 2.1 AA minimum** (legal requirement in many jurisdictions)
- **Keyboard navigation:** All interactive elements keyboard accessible (tab order logical)
- **Screen reader support:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, alt text for images

---

## Data Privacy & Security (Unstated Expectations)

- **Sensitive data:** Don't display in plain text (mask credit cards, SSNs, passwords)
- **Authentication:** Require login for personal data access
- **Session timeout:** Auto-logout after inactivity (typically 15-30 min)
- **Audit logging:** Track sensitive actions (for security and compliance)

**Design Implication:** "Design for security by default - mask sensitive data, require authentication, set expectations around timeouts"

</implicit_constraints>

<metric_driven_requirements>
For each success metric, translate into design requirements:

## Metric #1: [e.g., "Increase conversion rate by 10%"]

**Current Baseline:** [X]% conversion rate

**Target:** [Y]% conversion rate (10% relative increase)

**UX Outcomes Needed:**
- Reduce friction: Fewer steps, clearer CTAs, smart defaults
- Increase trust: Social proof, security badges, clear value proposition
- Improve clarity: Better copywriting, visual hierarchy, reduced cognitive load

**User Behaviors to Enable:**
- Users must understand value proposition within 5 seconds
- Users must complete key actions with minimal effort (ideally <3 clicks)
- Users must feel confident proceeding (reduce anxiety, increase trust)

**Friction to Remove:**
- Current friction: 12-field checkout form (reduce to 6 fields)
- Current friction: Unclear CTAs (test 3 CTA variants for clarity)
- Current friction: No trust signals (add security badges, testimonials)

**Design Requirements:**
1. Reduce checkout form from 12 to 6 fields (use smart defaults for the rest)
2. Test 3 CTA variants: "Buy Now", "Complete Purchase", "Checkout Securely"
3. Add trust badges above payment section (SSL, money-back guarantee, testimonials)
4. Improve visual hierarchy: Make CTA most prominent element on page (size, color, placement)

**Validation:**
- Usability testing: 90%+ of users complete checkout without confusion
- A/B test: New design increases conversion by 5-10%

---

## Metric #2: [e.g., "Increase feature adoption by 25%"]

**Current Baseline:** [X]% adoption

**Target:** [Y]% adoption (25% relative increase)

**UX Outcomes Needed:**
- Improve feature discoverability
- Clarify value proposition
- Support successful first-time use

**User Behaviors to Enable:**
- Users must notice the feature in normal workflows
- Users must understand why they should use it
- Users must succeed on first attempt

**Friction to Remove:**
- Hidden or buried entry points
- Jargon-heavy or vague copy
- Complex multi-step setup without guidance

**Design Requirements:**
1. Place feature entry point in primary navigation or key flow
2. Add contextual tooltip or nudge explaining value the first time it appears
3. Design a guided first-use flow or lightweight wizard
4. Provide clear success feedback and next-step suggestions

**Validation:**
- Usage analytics: Increase in first-time and repeat use
- Usability testing: Majority of users discover and use feature unaided

## Project-Specific Design Principles

These principles guide tradeoff decisions for this project:

### 1. [Principle Name]: [Principle Statement]

**What This Means:**
[Explain the principle in plain language]

**Tradeoff Guidance:**
When we must choose between [X] and [Y], we prioritize [X] because [reason]

**Example:**
[Concrete example of how this principle guides a design decision]

**Example Principle: Speed Over Polish**
- **Statement:** "Ship functional, usable designs quickly. Refine aesthetics in v2."
- **What This Means:** Prioritize getting core functionality in users' hands over pixel-perfect visual design. Design must be usable and brand-consistent, but doesn't need to be visually stunning in v1.
- **Tradeoff:** When choosing between "thorough visual design exploration" vs. "get prototype to users fast", choose speed.
- **Example:** "For v1, use standard design system components and straightforward layouts. Save custom illustrations and micro-interactions for v2."

---

### 2. [Principle]: [Statement]

**What This Means:**
[Explain the principle]

**Tradeoff Guidance:**
[Which side wins in conflicts]

**Example:**
[Concrete application]

---

[Continue for 5-7 principles total]

## Non-Negotiable Qualities

These qualities cannot be compromised:

1. **[Quality - e.g., Accessibility Compliance]**
   - We will always meet WCAG 2.1 AA, even if it means additional design/dev time
   - Why: Legal requirement, user trust, inclusive design is a core value

2. **[Quality - e.g., Data Security]**
   - We will always prioritize user data security, even if it adds friction
   - Why: User trust is foundational, security breaches are existential risk

3. **[Quality - e.g., Performance]**
   - We will always ship designs that load <3 seconds, even if it means reducing features
   - Why: Users abandon after 5 seconds, performance is part of UX quality

## What Can Be Compromised (If Necessary)

These are important but can be adjusted for higher priorities:

1. **Visual Polish:** Can be improved in v2 if timeline is constrained. Core functionality and usability cannot be compromised, but aesthetic refinement can wait.

2. **Edge Case Support:** Can defer rare edge cases to v2 if they significantly increase complexity. Support 80% of users excellently, handle 20% adequately.

3. **Feature Breadth:** Can launch with fewer features if it means shipping sooner. Better to do 3 things excellently than 10 things poorly.

</design_principles>

<information_gaps>
## Missing User Context

**Gap:** [What's unclear about users]

**Why This Matters:** [How this affects design decisions]

**Example:** "PM says 'design for mobile users' but doesn't specify: Are these existing users (familiar with product) or new users (need onboarding)? Are they using on-the-go (need quick access) or at desk (can handle complexity)?"

**Impact on Design:** Can't design appropriate level of guidance/onboarding without knowing user proficiency

**Clarifying Question:** "Which user segment are we designing for: power users who know the product, or first-time users who need guidance? What's their context of use: on-the-go or at desk?"

---

[Continue for all user context gaps]

## Unclear Success Criteria

**Gap:** [What's vague about success metrics]

**Why This Matters:** [Can't validate designs without clear metrics]

**Example:** "PM says 'improve user engagement' but doesn't define engagement. Does this mean DAU (daily active users), session length, actions per session, or feature usage?"

**Impact on Design:** Can't make informed tradeoff decisions without knowing what we're optimizing for

**Clarifying Question:** "How are we defining user engagement? What's the baseline and target? How will we measure it?"

---

[Continue for all success criteria gaps]

## Undefined Constraints

**Gap:** [What technical/business constraints are missing]

**Why This Matters:** [Can't design feasible solutions without constraints]

**Example:** "PM says 'integrate with CRM' but doesn't specify which CRM system, what APIs are available, or what data we can access"

**Impact on Design:** Can't design data displays or workflows without knowing what data is available

**Clarifying Question:** "Which CRM system are we integrating with? What APIs are available? What user data can we access? Are there rate limits or data freshness issues?"

---

[Continue for all undefined constraints]

## Ambiguous Requirements

**Gap:** [High-level or vague requirement]

**Why This Matters:** [Risk of designing wrong thing]

**Example:** "Support multiple payment methods" without details

**Clarifying Question:** "Which specific payment methods must we support in v1, and which can be deferred?"

---

## Clarifying Questions for PM

Prioritized list of questions that need answers before design can proceed effectively:

### Critical (Must answer before starting design):
1. [Question that blocks design work]
2. [Question that blocks design work]

### High Priority (Should answer in first week):

2. [Question that affects design direction]

### Medium Priority (Good to know, but can proceed without):
1. [Question that would inform design but not block it]
