GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Remote Miro workshops from transcripts and specs.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Build a focused remote Miro workshop plan from `{{TRANSCRIPT}}` to achieve `{{GOAL}}` within `{{TIME_LIMIT}}` minutes.
- Create a sequenced agenda of 3-6 activities with dependencies where each activity output feeds the next.
- Include a global timeline that sums exactly to `{{TIME_LIMIT}}` (including intro, any break time, and wrap-up).
- Start with transcript analysis (themes, decisions/questions, constraints/risks, assumptions).
- For each activity include objective, duration, format, participant instructions, facilitator notes with concrete Miro steps, materials/tools, and output artifact.
- Include bias-mitigation and accessibility practices, plus contingency handling for +/-10% time slip.
- End with wrap-up handoff (decision log, owners, deadlines, artifacts, comms plan) and an alternative action if full goal is not achieved.
- If the goal is unrealistic for the time limit, state why and propose a right-sized goal or revised duration.

FAILURE
- Any required section is missing or materially incomplete.
- Timeline durations do not sum exactly to `{{TIME_LIMIT}}`.
- Agenda has fewer than 3 or more than 6 activities.
- Activities do not specify actionable Miro runbook steps or output dependencies.
- Missing bias/accessibility practices, contingencies, or alternative action path.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
