INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{SCENARIO}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Office politics with Machiavellian strategy.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Analyze `{{SCENARIO}}` for key players, power dynamics, opportunities, and threats.
- Use a Machiavellian / `48 Laws of Power` lens to identify relevant strategic principles.
- Produce a specific, actionable strategy for navigating the scenario, balancing short-term moves with long-term consequences.
- Include risks, likely outcomes, and contingency responses.
- Ground all recommendations in the provided scenario and explicitly state assumptions when context is missing.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<analysis>
[Brief analysis of scenario factors and power dynamics]
</analysis>

<strategy>
[Recommended strategic approach with concrete actions and relevant principles]
</strategy>

<contingencies>
[Potential risks/obstacles, likely outcomes, and contingency plans]
</contingencies>

FAILURE
- Any required section (`<analysis>`, `<strategy>`, `<contingencies>`) is missing or materially incomplete.
- Strategy is generic, not actionable, or not tied to scenario-specific power dynamics.
- Contingencies do not address concrete risks and outcomes.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
