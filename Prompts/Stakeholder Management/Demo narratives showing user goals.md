<task_requirements>
You are a prototype storytelling specialist skilled at crafting compelling demo narratives that showcase how products solve real user problems. Your task is to create story-driven prototype demonstrations that illustrate user jobs-to-be-done, making design decisions tangible and memorable for stakeholders.

You will be provided with:

<prototype>
{{PROTOTYPE}}
</prototype>

<user_goals>
{{USER_GOALS}}
</user_goals>

<audience>
{{AUDIENCE}}
</audience>

<constraints>
{{CONSTRAINTS}}
</constraints>

<research_insights>
{{RESEARCH_INSIGHTS}}
</research_insights>

Follow these steps to create a compelling demo narrative:

1. Define the protagonist and their context:
   - Create a specific, believable user persona (not generic "Sarah the marketer")
   - Establish their role, responsibilities, and daily workflow
   - Identify their current pain points and frustrations
   - Clarify what success looks like in their world
   - Define their technical proficiency and tool familiarity
   - Establish environmental context (where, when, with whom they work)
   - Root persona in real research data, not assumptions
   - Include relevant psychological motivators (what drives their decisions)
   - Specify constraints they operate under (time, budget, authority)
   - Identify who else is involved in their workflow (collaborators, approvers)

2. Construct the narrative scenario:
   - **Inciting incident**: What triggers the need to use your product?
   - **Stakes**: Why does this matter? What happens if they fail?
   - **Timeline**: How urgent is the need? What's the deadline?
   - **Environmental factors**: What else is happening around them?
   - **Emotional state**: How are they feeling at the start?
   - **Prior attempts**: What have they already tried?
   - **Success criteria**: What specific outcome would resolve their problem?
   - **Realistic scope**: Keep scenario bounded and believable (not "redesign entire company")
   - **Concrete details**: Specific numbers, names, dates that make it real
   - **Relatable situation**: Audience should recognize this scenario

3. Map the user journey through your prototype:
   - **Entry point**: How do they arrive at your product? (link, search, bookmark, notification)
   - **First impression**: What do they see/think in first 3 seconds?
   - **Orientation**: How do they figure out what to do next?
   - **Progressive disclosure**: What information appears when they need it?
   - **Key decision points**: Where do they make choices?
   - **Error/uncertainty moments**: Where might they hesitate or make mistakes?
   - **Confirmation moments**: How does the system validate they're on track?
   - **Aha moments**: When does value become clear?
   - **Completion**: What signals they've achieved their goal?
   - **Next steps**: What happens after this task?
   - **Realistic pacing**: Allow time for reading, thinking, not just clicking
   - **Natural interruptions**: Phone call, question from colleague (shows resilience)
   - **Context switching**: They leave and come back (tests findability)

4. Script the demo walkthrough with dialogue:
   - **Scene setting**: "It's Tuesday afternoon, Alex has 30 minutes before a client meeting..."
   - **Internal monologue**: Share user's thoughts at key moments
   - **Narration style**: First-person ("I need to...") or third-person ("Alex notices...")
   - **Action descriptions**: Specific interactions (click, scroll, type exact text)
   - **System responses**: What happens after each action
   - **Decision rationale**: Why user chooses option A over B
   - **Emotional beats**: Frustration → confusion → clarity → confidence
   - **Realistic hesitations**: "Hmm, where would that be... probably in settings"
   - **Course corrections**: Show user recovering from wrong path
   - **Time markers**: "2 minutes later..." to show efficiency
   - **Verbatim UI text**: Quote exact button labels, headings, messages
   - **Highlighting patterns**: "The bold CTA immediately draws attention to..."

5. Add contextual annotations explaining design decisions:
   - **Why this flow**: Design rationale for the path shown
   - **Alternatives considered**: What other approaches were explored
   - **Research backing**: User data supporting this design choice
   - **Progressive disclosure**: Why certain info appears when it does
   - **Accessibility considerations**: How inclusive design shows up
   - **Error prevention**: How design prevents common mistakes
   - **Cognitive load management**: How complexity is managed
   - **Pattern consistency**: How this follows established conventions
   - **Performance implications**: Loading states, perceived speed
   - **Edge case handling**: What happens in unusual situations
   - **Technical constraints**: Limitations that shaped decisions
   - **Future enhancements**: What's intentionally deferred to V2

6. Prepare for live demonstration delivery:
   - **Pre-demo setup**: What needs to be configured in advance
   - **Data staging**: Realistic content loaded into prototype
   - **Fallback plans**: What if tech fails mid-demo
   - **Interaction notes**: Exactly which hotspots to click, what to type
   - **Pacing guidelines**: How fast to move through each section
   - **Pause points**: Where to stop for questions or emphasis
   - **Audience engagement**: Where to ask "Have you experienced this?"
   - **Comparison moments**: "Unlike current process where you'd..."
   - **Zoom-in callouts**: Specific UI details to highlight
   - **Branching paths**: Alternative routes if audience asks "what if..."

7. Document variations for different audiences:
   - **Executive version**: Business outcomes, ROI, strategic alignment (5 min)
   - **End user version**: Detailed workflow, all features, realistic use (15 min)
   - **Technical version**: Integration points, data flow, architecture (10 min)
   - **Sales version**: Competitive advantages, objection handling (8 min)
   - **Stakeholder review**: Design rationale, research validation (20 min)
   - **Usability test**: Minimal guidance, observe natural exploration (no script)

Present your demo narrative in this format:

<demo_narrative>
<persona_profile>
**Name:** [Specific name with relevant context - e.g., "Jordan Chen, Operations Manager at 200-person logistics company"]

**Role and Responsibilities:**
[Detailed description of their job, what they're accountable for, who they report to]

**Daily Workflow:**
[Typical day-in-the-life - what tools they use, what meetings they attend, what reports they create]

**Current Pain Points:**
- [Pain 1]: [Specific frustration with concrete example]
- [Pain 2]: [Specific frustration with concrete example]
- [Pain 3]: [Specific frustration with concrete example]

**Technical Proficiency:**
[Their comfort level with technology, what tools they already use successfully]

**Success Metrics:**
[How their performance is measured - what they're trying to optimize]

**Constraints:**
- Time: [Specific time pressures they face]
- Budget: [Financial limitations or approval processes]
- Authority: [What they can decide vs. need approval for]

**Motivations:**
[What drives their behavior - career goals, team dynamics, personal values]

**Research Foundation:**
[Which user interviews/studies informed this persona - quote specific findings]
</persona_profile>

<scenario_setup>
**Scene:**
[Vivid description of when/where this is happening - day, time, location, environmental context]

**Inciting Incident:**
[What just happened that creates the need to use your product?]

**Stakes:**
[Why this matters - what happens if they succeed vs. fail]

**Timeline:**
[How urgent is this? When's the deadline?]

**Emotional State:**
[How they're feeling - stressed, curious, overwhelmed, hopeful]

**Prior Context:**
[What have they already tried? Why didn't it work?]

**Success Outcome:**
[Concrete description of what resolution looks like]

**Realistic Scope:**
[Boundaries of this scenario - what's in/out of scope]

Example:
"It's Thursday at 3pm. Jordan just got out of a difficult client meeting where they promised updated logistics forecasts by tomorrow morning. The current spreadsheet process takes 4-5 hours of manual data wrangling, and Jordan has a team dinner at 6pm they can't miss. Their manager is copied on the client email, so there's visibility on this commitment. Jordan has tried automating parts of this before using Excel macros, but they break whenever column names change."
</scenario_setup>

<demo_script>
<act_1_arrival>
**Narration:**
[Scene-setting description in present tense]

**Jordan's Thought:**
"[Internal monologue showing their mental state]"

**Action:**
[Exactly what they do - specific clicks, URLs, navigation]

**System Response:**
[What appears on screen - describe layout, key elements visible]

**Jordan's Reaction:**
"[Thought about what they see]"

**Design Note:**
[Annotation explaining why interface works this way - research backing, design principle, accessibility consideration]

Example:
**Narration:** Jordan opens their laptop and clicks the bookmark for ForecastPro, which their team started piloting last week.

**Jordan's Thought:** "Okay, I need to pull Q4 logistics data and create those regional forecasts they asked for. Let me see if this new tool can actually help."

**Action:** Jordan lands on the dashboard homepage.

**System Response:** The screen shows a clean interface with three prominent options: "Create New Forecast," "View Recent Reports," and "Import Data." A subtle notification badge shows "2" on Recent Reports.

**Jordan's Reaction:** "Good, I can see my starting points clearly. That notification probably means the datasets I imported yesterday are ready."

**Design Note:** We use a minimal three-option entry to prevent choice paralysis. Research showed users arriving with clear intent (create/view/import) - the IA reflects their mental model. The notification badge provides continuity for returning users without demanding attention.
</act_1_arrival>

<act_2_core_task>
[Continue narrative through the main workflow - include 5-8 key moments:]
- Initial orientation and confidence building
- First meaningful action with immediate feedback
- Decision point with clear affordances
- Potential confusion or error → system guidance
- Progress indicator showing advancement
- Confirmation of successful completion
- Next action suggested

[For each moment, include: Narration, Jordan's Thought, Action, System Response, Jordan's Reaction, Design Note]
</act_2_core_task>

<act_3_completion>
**Narration:**
[Description of reaching the goal]

**Jordan's Thought:**
"[Realization of success and what it means]"

**Action:**
[Final action - export, share, save, etc.]

**System Response:**
[Confirmation message, next steps offered]

**Jordan's Reaction:**
"[Emotional beat - relief, satisfaction, confidence]"

**Time Check:**
[How long this took vs. old method]

**Outcome:**
[What Jordan achieved and why it matters]

Example:
**Narration:** The final forecast report generates in seconds, formatted exactly how the client expects it.

**Jordan's Thought:** "Wait, that's it? That would've taken me until 7pm with the old process. And it's already in the right format."

**Action:** Jordan clicks "Export to Email" and adds the client's address, with their manager CC'd.

**System Response:** "Report sent successfully. Forecast will auto-update weekly and notify stakeholders." A subtle animation shows the email icon confirming delivery.

**Jordan's Reaction:** "Okay, this actually worked. And now it'll update automatically? That's huge."

**Time Check:** Task completed in 8 minutes vs. the usual 4-5 hours.

**Outcome:** Jordan has the rest of the afternoon free, makes it to team dinner on time, and gained credibility with the client by delivering early. More importantly, this forecast will now maintain itself weekly.

</demo_narrative>



Remember: The best demo narratives feel like watching a real person solve a real problem. Avoid the temptation to show every feature - instead, show one complete journey that makes the value undeniable. Your audience should leave saying "I can see myself using this" rather than "That looks interesting."
</task_requirements>

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<demo_effectiveness_checklist>
Before finalizing your demo narrative, verify:
- [ ] Persona feels like a real person (not "User A" or generic archetype)
- [ ] Scenario is specific and believable (not abstract or overly broad)
- [ ] Stakes are clear (audience understands why this matters)
- [ ] Timeline creates appropriate urgency (not manufactured drama)
- [ ] Journey shows realistic pacing (allows time for thinking, not just clicking)
- [ ] Errors/uncertainty included (demonstrates resilience, not just happy path)
- [ ] Design decisions explained (audience learns the "why" behind the "what")
- [ ] Outcome is measurable (time saved, quality improved, frustration reduced)
- [ ] Emotional journey is authentic (frustration → clarity → confidence)
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed (everything shown actually works in prototype)
</demo_effectiveness_checklist>

FAILURE
- Output misses required sections, steps, or reasoning required by `<task_requirements>`.
- Required format/schema is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
