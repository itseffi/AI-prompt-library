</value_evaluation>

<decision_options>
## Option 1: Add to Scope with Timeline Extension

**Description:** Include new request, extend deadline to accommodate full effort

**Timeline Change:**
- **Original deadline:** [Date]
- **New deadline:** [Date] (+X days/weeks)

**Cost:**
- **Delayed launch:** [Business impact - e.g., "Miss Q4 launch window"]
- **Missed market timing:** [If applicable - competitive announcement, seasonal timing]
- **Stakeholder impact:** [Who this affects and how]
- **Team impact:** [Extended project, potential fatigue]

**Benefit:**
- Full scope delivered with quality
- No compromises to existing commitments
- Team has adequate time for quality work
- All value realized: [New request + existing scope]

**Tradeoff Summary:** More complete product, later delivery

**When to Choose:** Market timing is flexible and complete feature set is more important than launch date

**Risks:**
- [Market window may close]
- [Competitor may launch first]
- [Team morale if project extends too long]

## Option 2: Swap for Existing Scope (Maintain Timeline)

**Description:** Include new request, cut other work to maintain timeline

**What Gets Cut:**

**Cut Item 1:** [Name]
- **Description:** [What this is]
- **Value lost:** [User impact X/10, Business impact Y/10]
- **Justification for cut:** [Why this is lower priority than new request]
- **Effort saved:** [X days]

**Cut Item 2:** [Name]
[Same structure]

[Continue...]

**Cost:**
- Lost value from cut items: [Total value score]
- Potential technical debt: [If cutting quality work]
- Future rework: [If cut items need revisiting later]

**Benefit:**
- Maintain original timeline
- Deliver new request at launch
- Value of new request realized: [Score]

**Tradeoff Summary:** Different scope, same timeline

**When to Choose:** New request is higher value than what would be cut, and timeline is immovable

**Risks:**
- [Value judgment may be wrong - cut item may prove more important]
- [User confusion if expected features are missing]

## Option 3: Defer to Next Phase/Release

**Description:** Maintain current scope and timeline, add new request to future backlog

**Next Opportunity:** [When this could be addressed - e.g., "Q2 2025 release"]

**Cost:**
- Short-term: Users don't benefit from new request at launch
- Temporary workaround: [How users handle gap until next release]
- Potential competitive gap: [If this is competitive feature]

**Benefit:**
- Maintain scope, timeline, quality of current release
- Team delivers committed work excellently
- Validate need post-launch: [Can gather user feedback first]
- Time to implement properly: [More thoughtful with v1 learnings]

**Tradeoff Summary:** Launch on time with committed scope, add later

**When to Choose:** Current scope is sufficient for launch and new request can wait for v2

**Risks:**
- [Users may complain about missing feature]
- [Competitive gap if feature is table stakes]

## Option 4: Deliver Simplified/MVP Version

**Description:** Include reduced version delivering core value with less effort

**Simplified Scope:**
- **Included:** [Core functionality in MVP]
- **Deferred:** [Advanced features, edge cases, polish saved for v2]

**Effort Comparison:**
- **Original estimate:** [X days]
- **Simplified version:** [Y days]
- **Savings:** [Z days]

**Cost:**
- Reduced functionality: [What users don't get]
- Future enhancement needed: [Likely to revisit]
- Potential user confusion: [If simplified version has limitations]

**Benefit:**
- Partial value realized now
- Lower cost and risk
- Validate before full investment
- Enhance in future based on usage

**Tradeoff Summary:** Some value now, full value later

**When to Choose:** Core value can be delivered simply and full version can wait for validation

**Risks:**
- [Users may be confused by limitations]
- [May create technical debt if MVP not architected for future expansion]

## Option 5: Reject (Maintain Current Plan)

**Description:** Do not include new request in current project

**Cost:**
- Value of request not realized
- Requester may be disappointed
- Potential missed opportunity

**Benefit:**
- Team maintains focus
- Delivers committed work with quality
- Preserves timeline and stakeholder commitments

**Tradeoff Summary:** Focused delivery of original scope

**When to Choose:** New request is significantly lower value than committed work and can be addressed separately (or not at all)

**Risks:**
- [Requester pushback]
- [May have been right that this was important]

<decision_framework>
## Questions to Guide Decision

**Must-Have Test:**
- Is this absolutely required for product to be useful/sellable at launch?
- Why or why not?
- What's the minimum viable version needed?

**User Workaround Assessment:**
- Can users accomplish their goal without this feature?
- What's the cost of that workaround (time, frustration, errors)?
- Is the workaround acceptable short-term?

**Delay Cost Analysis:**
- What happens if we launch without this and add it in next release?
- Do we lose customers, revenue, or competitive position?
- Or is delay impact minimal?

**Value Comparison:**
- Is this higher priority than what it would delay or replace?
- Run the value scores side-by-side
- What do users and business need most?

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Are we willing to accept quality/timeline tradeoffs to include this?
- What risks are acceptable vs. unacceptable?
- What's our risk appetite right now?

**Strategic Lens:**
- Does this advance our strategic vision and differentiation?
- Or is this a distraction from core value proposition?

## Decision Criteria

**Inclusion threshold:**
- If [User impact score × Business impact score] ≥ [Threshold - e.g., 50], strongly consider including
- If below threshold, likely defer or reject

**Capacity check:**
- If [Effort estimate] > [Available capacity buffer], timeline MUST extend or scope MUST swap
- If within buffer, can potentially absorb

**Timeline constraint:**
- If [Timeline delay] > [Acceptable window - e.g., 2 weeks], must cut other scope or reject
- If within acceptable delay, timeline extension is option

**Authority escalation:**
- If requester is [C-level or VP], escalate to [decision maker at same level]
- Ensure tradeoffs are visible to appropriate decision-making level

## Escalation Triggers

**Escalate to [Leadership Level] if:**
- Timeline impact exceeds [X weeks]
- Scope change affects previously communicated external commitments (customer, press, partnerships)
- Multiple senior stakeholders disagree on priority
- Request comes from executive leadership (requires executive tradeoff discussion)
- Team flags significant technical risk, debt, or feasibility concerns

**Decision Owner:** [Role - PM, Design Lead, Director, VP, etc.]

**Decision Timeline:** Decision must be made by [Date] to avoid impacting project critical path

</decision_framework>

<assumptions_and_next_steps>
## Key Assumptions

**Assumption 1:** [e.g., "Effort estimate assumes no major technical blockers"]
- **Validation needed:** [Engineering spike or deeper technical review]
- **If wrong:** [Impact on recommendation]

**Assumption 2:** [e.g., "User impact score based on current usage patterns"]
- **Validation needed:** [User research or analytics review]
- **If wrong:** [Impact on recommendation]

**Assumption 3:** [e.g., "Timeline extension assumes no dependencies on other teams"]
- **Validation needed:** [Confirm with dependent teams]
- **If wrong:** [Impact on recommendation]

[Continue for all key assumptions]

- Update project plan with new scope
- Adjust milestones and timeline
- Communicate changes to team and affected stakeholders
- Update external commitments (if timeline changed)
- Reprioritize backlog (if scope swapped)

**If deferred (Option 3):**
- Add to backlog with full context from this analysis
- Set review date for next planning cycle [Date]
- Communicate decision and rationale to requester
- Document why deferred for future reference

**If rejected (Option 5):**
- Document decision and rationale
- Communicate thoughtfully to requester (explain tradeoffs, not just "no")
- Note for future: if this request returns, reference this analysis

**Communication Plan:**
