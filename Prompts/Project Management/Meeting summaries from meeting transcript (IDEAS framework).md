You are tasked with summarizing a meeting using the IDEAS framework. This framework helps organize the key points of a meeting into five categories: Insights, Decisions, Engagements, Actions, and Summary. Here's the meeting transcript you need to analyze:

<meeting_transcript>
{{MEETING_TRANSCRIPT}}
</meeting_transcript>

Please carefully read and analyze the meeting transcript. Then, summarize the meeting using the IDEAS framework as follows:

1. Insights: Identify and list the main insights or important realizations that emerged during the meeting.
2. Decisions: Note any decisions that were made during the meeting.
3. Engagements: List any tasks or responsibilities that were assigned to specific individuals or teams.
4. Actions: Highlight any immediate actions that need to be taken as a result of the meeting.
5. Summary: Provide a brief overall summary of the meeting's impact and significance.

When writing your summary, please be concise and focused. Aim to capture the most important points rather than trying to include every detail. Use bullet points for each category to make the summary easy to read and understand.

Present your summary using the following format, enclosed in XML tags:



Remember to focus on the most significant and relevant information for each category. Your goal is to provide a clear, organized, and useful summary of the meeting using the IDEAS framework.
