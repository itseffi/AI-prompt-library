INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{PROJECT_BRIEF}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: "Detailed project plans from project briefs".
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Build a detailed, realistic project plan from `{{PROJECT_BRIEF}}`, including:
- Project objectives, deliverables, constraints, and deadlines from the brief.
- Task/subtask breakdown with duration and resource estimates.
- Day-by-day plan, then weekly milestones, then monthly goals.
- Critical path analysis and schedule impact of delays.
- Risk assessment with likelihood, impact, and mitigation.
- Ambiguity review covering: what is unclear, why it matters, and how to resolve it.
- Final summary of timeline, milestones, critical path, and top risks.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<project_plan>
<summary>
[Include your project summary here]
</summary>

<daily_plan>
[Include your day-by-day breakdown here]
</daily_plan>

<weekly_plan>
[Include your week-by-week plan here]
</weekly_plan>

<monthly_plan>
[Include your month-by-month plan here]
</monthly_plan>

<critical_path>
[Include your critical path analysis here]

<risk_management>
[Include your risk assessment and mitigation strategies here]
</risk_management>
</project_plan>

<ambiguities>
[Include your analysis of ambiguous areas and proposed solutions here]
</ambiguities>

FAILURE
- Any required section (`<summary>`, `<daily_plan>`, `<weekly_plan>`, `<monthly_plan>`, `<critical_path>`, `<risk_management>`, `<ambiguities>`) is missing or materially incomplete.
- Timeline logic is inconsistent across daily/weekly/monthly levels.
- Critical path, risks, or ambiguity handling is missing, shallow, or not actionable.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
