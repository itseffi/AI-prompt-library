- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.

- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Use the refinement guide to plan a session for `{{TOPIC}}`.
- Produce:
- A timeboxed agenda aligned to the guide’s phases.

# Product Refinement Session Guide
## Purpose
A refinement session is NOT about estimating solutions, but rather:
- Understanding problems deeply
- Determining solution requirements
- Building shared team understanding
- Defining clear success criteria
## Pre-Session Preparation
### For Product Manager/Owner
1. Identify key items for refinement
   - Select items that align with current priorities
   - Focus on problems that need immediate attention
2. Share materials in advance
   - Distribute selected items to team 24 hours before session
   - Give team time to review and reflect
   - Include any relevant context or background information
### For Team Members
1. Review shared materials
2. Note initial questions and concerns
3. Consider potential problem areas that need clarification
## During the Session
### 1. Context Setting (15-20 minutes)
- PM/PO clearly articulates:
  - Current business priorities
  - Strategic context
  - Why these items matter now
  - How they align with broader goals
### 2. Problem Space Exploration (40-45 minutes)
- Discuss each refinement item:
  - Define the core problem
  - Identify affected stakeholders
  - Map out dependencies
  - Document constraints
  - Clarify assumptions
### 3. Success Criteria Definition (20-25 minutes)
- Define clear outcomes:
  - What does success look like?
  - How will we measure it?
  - What are the acceptance criteria?
  - What are the non-negotiables?
### 4. Discussion Management
- Timeboxed conversations
- Park tangential discussions
- Document open questions
- Capture action items
### 5. Session Retrospective (10-15 minutes)
- Gather feedback on:
  - Session effectiveness
  - Discussion quality
  - Time management
  - Areas for improvement
  - What worked well
## Post-Session Actions
### 1. Documentation
- Update refinement items with new insights
- Document decisions and rationale
- Share session notes
### 2. Follow-up
- Address parked items
- Schedule any needed deep-dives
- Assign action items
### 3. Preparation for Next Session
- Apply retrospective feedback
- Begin identifying next batch of items
- Update session format based on team input
## Success Indicators
- Team has clear understanding of problems
- Success criteria are well-defined
- Next steps are clearly documented
- Team is aligned on priorities
- Everyone understands their role in solution development
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Jumping to solutions too quickly
- Not timeboxing discussions
- Lack of preparation
- Missing key stakeholders
- Focusing on estimation instead of understanding
