GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Requirements prioritization with P0-P1-P2 framework.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Prioritize `{{REQUIREMENTS_LIST}}` using the P0/P1/P2 framework in the context of `{{PRODUCT_CONTEXT}}` and `{{CONSTRAINTS}}`.
- Apply explicit prioritization tests for each tier (P0/P1/P2) and challenge “must-have” claims.
- Use effort vs. value to support decisions and identify descoping options if capacity is exceeded.
- Provide rationale, evidence, and acceptance criteria for each requirement.
- Produce a capacity analysis and a stakeholder communication plan.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<requirements_prioritization>
<prioritization_framework>
**P0 Definition (Launch Blocker):**
[Your specific definition for this project:
- Without this, users cannot [core task]
- Without this, product fails [critical requirement]
- Must-have criteria: [specific tests]]

**P1 Definition (High Value):**
[Your specific definition for this project:
- Significantly improves [key experience]
- Enables [important use case]
- Should-have criteria: [specific tests]]

**P2 Definition (Nice-to-Have):**
[Your specific definition for this project:
- Enhances [aspect of experience]
- Valuable but users can accomplish goals without it
- Nice-to-have criteria: [specific tests]]

**Prioritization Principles:**
[3-5 principles guiding decisions for this project:
- "Core user task enablement trumps convenience features"
- "Baseline quality must be met (P0) before adding polish (P2)"]
</prioritization_framework>

<prioritized_requirements>
<p0_requirements>
[For each P0 requirement:

**Requirement:** [Clear description]

**Why P0:**
[Specific justification using P0 criteria]

**Impact if Missing:**
[Concrete description of what breaks without this]

**User Tasks Blocked:**
[Which core user tasks become impossible]

**Evidence:**
[Data/research supporting this priority]

**Effort Estimate:**
[Time/complexity]

**Dependencies:**
[What else must exist for this to work]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
[Minimum bar for "done" on this requirement]]
</p0_requirements>

<p1_requirements>
[For each P1 requirement:

**Requirement:** [Clear description]

**Why P1:**
[Specific justification using P1 criteria]

**Value if Included:**
[Concrete benefits of including this]

**Impact if Missing:**
[What degrades without this, but doesn't break]

**User Tasks Affected:**
[Which tasks become harder but still possible]

**Evidence:**
[Data/research supporting value]

**Effort Estimate:**
[Time/complexity]

**Could Descope to:**
[Simpler version that captures core value]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
[Minimum bar for "done"]]
</p1_requirements>

<p2_requirements>
[For each P2 requirement:

**Requirement:** [Clear description]

**Why P2:**
[Why it's nice-to-have but not critical]

**Value:**
[What it adds]

**Defer Rationale:**
[Why it's okay to wait]

**Effort Estimate:**
[Time/complexity]

**Post-Launch Timeline:**
[When to revisit]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
[If we did build it, what's the bar]]
</p2_requirements>
</prioritized_requirements>

<challenged_priorities>
[For items originally claimed as "must-have" but deprioritized:

**Requirement:** [Description]

**Originally Claimed As:** [P0/P1]

**Actually:** [P1/P2]

**Why Deprioritized:**
[Reason it's not as critical as claimed]

**Supporting Evidence:**
[Why this priority is more accurate]

**Alternative:**
[How users can accomplish goal without this, or simpler version]]
</challenged_priorities>

<effort_value_matrix>
[Create a 2x2 showing:
**High Value / Low Effort (Do First):**
- [List requirements]

**High Value / High Effort (Evaluate):**
- [List requirements]
- [For each: Is value worth effort? Can we simplify?]

**Low Value / Low Effort (Nice-to-have):**
- [List requirements]
- [Consider: Worth including or better to focus elsewhere?]

**Low Value / High Effort (Descope):**
- [List requirements]
- [Rationale for cutting]]
</effort_value_matrix>

<capacity_analysis>
**Total Requirements:**
- P0: [count] items = [estimated effort]
- P1: [count] items = [estimated effort]
- P2: [count] items = [estimated effort]
- Total: [total effort]

**Available Capacity:**
[Team capacity for this release]

**Gap Analysis:**
- P0 fit: [Yes/No - if no, how much over?]
- P0 + P1 fit: [Yes/No - if no, which P1 to defer?]
- P0 + P1 + P2 fit: [Almost certainly no]

**Conclusion:**
[What's realistic to complete]
</capacity_analysis>

<descoping_options>
[If capacity is exceeded, propose descoping approaches:

**Option 1: Defer All P2**
- What's cut: [List P2 items]
- What's preserved: [All P0/P1]
- Impact: [Minimal - nice-to-haves wait]

**Option 2: Defer Low-Effort P1 + All P2**
- What's cut: [Specific P1 items]
- What's preserved: [High-value P0/P1]
- Rationale: [Why these P1 items can wait]
- Impact: [Description]

**Option 3: Simplify High-Effort P1**
- What's simplified: [Specific items]
- Simplified version: [Description]
- Value preserved: [What's kept]
- Impact: [Tradeoffs]

**Recommended Approach:**
[Which option, with rationale]]
</descoping_options>

<decision_documentation>
**Prioritization Decision Log:**
[Template for documenting:
- Requirement
- Priority assignment (P0/P1/P2)
- Rationale
- Decision maker
- Date
- Conditions that would change priority]
</decision_documentation>

<communication_plan>
**How to Present Prioritization:**
[Guidance for sharing with stakeholders:
- Lead with framework and principles
- Show evidence for priorities
- Be explicit about tradeoffs
- Invite challenge on specific items
- Document decisions]

**Handling "Everything is P0" Stakeholders:**
[Tactics for managing pushback:
- Apply prioritization tests consistently
- Show capacity constraints
- Offer descoping choices
- Escalate if needed]
</communication_plan>
</requirements_prioritization>

FAILURE
- Any required section in `<requirements_prioritization>` is missing or materially incomplete.
- Requirements lack evidence-based rationale or acceptance criteria.
- Capacity analysis or descoping options are missing when P0+P1 exceed capacity.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
