- {{TIME_SINCE_RESEARCH}}

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Aging research insight validation before reusing.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Evaluate research currency using `{{EXISTING_RESEARCH}}`, `{{CURRENT_CONTEXT}}`, and `{{TIME_SINCE_RESEARCH}}`.
- Assess decay factors (time, market, product, user base, competition, contextual/regulatory changes).
- Classify insights by confidence (`high`, `medium`, `low`) with evidence and caveats.
- Identify stable insight patterns vs decayed patterns.
- Propose validation research (quick validation + deeper follow-up), testable hypotheses, and prioritized research gaps.
- Provide clear guidance on what is safe to use now, what to use cautiously, and what to retire.
- Respect prior research investment while being explicit about limitations and assumptions.

<insight_validity_assessment>
<high_confidence_insights>
[Insights that are likely still valid:

**Insight:** [Original finding]

**Type:** [Fundamental need / Core job / Deep motivation]

**Why Still Valid:**
[Reasoning for confidence]

**Evidence:**
[Any recent signals supporting this]

**Caveat:**
[Any context to consider]

**Recommended Use:**
[How to apply this insight today]]
</high_confidence_insights>

<medium_confidence_insights>
[Insights that should be validated:

**Insight:** [Original finding]

**Type:** [Behavior / Pain point / Preference / Workflow]

**Decay Concern:**
[What might have changed]

**Current Confidence:** [50-75%]

**Validation Needed:**
[Specific questions to answer]

**Quick Validation:**
[Lightweight way to check if still true]

**Use As:**
[Hypothesis to test, not fact to assume]]
</medium_confidence_insights>

<low_confidence_insights>
[Insights that are likely outdated:

**Insight:** [Original finding]

**Why Likely Invalid:**
[Specific decay factors]

**Current Confidence:** [<50%]

**Recommendation:**
[Don't rely on this - research fresh]

**New Research Needed:**
[What to study instead]]
</low_confidence_insights>
</insight_validity_assessment>

<patterns_of_decay>
**What Types of Insights Have Decayed:**
[Common patterns: e.g., "Tool-specific workflows are outdated" or "Pain points around X have been solved"]

**What Remains Stable:**
[Common patterns: e.g., "Core job of [Y] hasn't changed" or "Fundamental need for [Z] still exists"]

**Decay Acceleration Factors:**
[What makes insights go stale faster in this domain]
</patterns_of_decay>

<validation_research_plan>
**Critical Questions to Answer:**
1. [Question that would validate/invalidate high-priority insight]
2. [Question that would validate/invalidate high-priority insight]
3. [Question that would validate/invalidate high-priority insight]

**Proposed Research Approach:**

**Phase 1: Quick Validation (1-2 weeks)**
- Method: [Lightweight approach: surveys, analytics review, stakeholder interviews]
- Purpose: [Confirm or refute medium-confidence insights]
- Sample: [Who to include]
- Key questions: [List]

**Phase 2: Deep Dive (3-4 weeks, if needed)**
- Method: [Rigorous approach: user interviews, observation, diary studies]
- Purpose: [Generate fresh insights on areas of uncertainty]
- Sample: [Who to include]
- Key questions: [List]

**Decision Point:**
- After Phase 1: [Determine if Phase 2 is needed]
- Criteria: [What findings would trigger deeper research]
</validation_research_plan>

<hypothesis_generation>
[Convert old insights into testable hypotheses:

**Old Insight:** [Original finding]

**Current Hypothesis:** [Reformulated as testable statement]

**Test:** [How to validate]

**If True:** [What it means for design]

**If False:** [What it means for design]

**Alternative Hypotheses:**
[Other possibilities to consider]]
</hypothesis_generation>

<research_gaps>
**What We Don't Know:**
[List critical unknowns not covered by old research:
- New user segments
- New use cases
- New competitors/alternatives
- New technologies
- New constraints]

**Priority:**
[Which gaps are most critical to fill]

**Proposed Research:**
[How to fill each gap]
</research_gaps>

<safe_to_use>
**Insights You Can Use Today:**
[List high-confidence insights with caveats]

**Use With Caution:**
[List medium-confidence insights with required validation]

**Don't Use:**
[List low-confidence insights to discard]
</safe_to_use>

<research_hygiene>
**Best Practices Going Forward:**
- Research expiration dating: [Label research with "valid until" or "revalidate by"]
- Decay indicators: [Track market/product changes that invalidate research]
- Continuous learning: [Lightweight ongoing research to keep insights fresh]
- Research library: [System for marking outdated research]
- Validation triggers: [Events that should trigger revalidation]
</research_hygiene>

<communication>
**How to Present to Team:**
[Guidance for explaining which research to trust:
- Be transparent about confidence levels
- Explain decay factors
- Propose validation plan
- Don't dismiss old research entirely - use as starting point]

**Research Debt Message:**
[Draft message explaining need for fresh research while respecting past investment]
</communication>
</research_validation_assessment>

FAILURE
- Any required section in `<research_validation_assessment>` is missing or materially incomplete.
- Confidence classifications are unsupported by decay-factor reasoning.
- Validation plan lacks concrete questions, methods, or decision criteria.
- Safe-to-use guidance does not clearly separate `use now` / `use with caution` / `don't use`.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
