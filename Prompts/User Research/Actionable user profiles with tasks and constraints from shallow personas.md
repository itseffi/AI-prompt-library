INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{EXISTING_PERSONA}}
- {{AVAILABLE_USER_DATA}}
- {{PRODUCT_CONTEXT}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Actionable user profiles with tasks and constraints from shallow personas.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Transform `{{EXISTING_PERSONA}}` into an actionable user profile using `{{AVAILABLE_USER_DATA}}` and `{{PRODUCT_CONTEXT}}`.
- Replace vague persona language with specific, observable details:
- Concrete tasks and success outcomes.
- Jobs-to-be-done (functional, emotional, social).
- Capabilities, constraints, and behavioral patterns.
- Grounded contextual scenarios.
- Design implications directly tied to profile evidence.
- Explicit research gaps and validation plan for missing/uncertain assumptions.
- Keep all claims evidence-linked; state assumptions when data is incomplete.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<actionable_user_profile>
<profile_summary>
**Role:** [Specific job title and organizational context]
**Core Responsibility:** [What they're accountable for]
**Primary Goal:** [What success looks like in their role]
</profile_summary>

<jobs_to_be_done>
<functional_jobs>
[List 5-7 specific tasks they need to accomplish related to this product:
- Example: "Create quarterly budget forecast for leadership review"
- Example: "Onboard new team members to project workflows within first week"]
</functional_jobs>

<emotional_jobs>
[List 3-5 emotional needs:
- Example: "Feel confident in decisions without analysis paralysis"
- Example: "Avoid embarrassment from missing important details"]
</emotional_jobs>

<social_jobs>
[List 2-3 social needs:
- Example: "Be seen as data-driven and strategic by leadership"
- Example: "Maintain credibility with engineering team"]
</social_jobs>
</jobs_to_be_done>

<user_capabilities>
**Technical Sophistication:**
[Describe their comfort with technology, tools they know, learning curve tolerance]

**Domain Expertise:**
[Describe their knowledge of the problem domain, industry experience, specialized skills]

**Decision Authority:**
[Describe what they can decide independently vs. what requires approval]

**Time Availability:**
[Describe their time constraints, competing priorities, typical workflow rhythm]

**Resources:**
[Describe what tools, data, people, budget they have access to]
</user_capabilities>

<constraints>
**Organizational Constraints:**
[List policies, processes, approval chains that limit their options]

**Technical Constraints:**
[List system limitations, integrations, legacy tools they must work with]

**Knowledge Constraints:**
[List gaps in their knowledge, areas where they need guidance]

**Time Constraints:**
[List deadlines, recurring obligations, busy periods]

**Resource Constraints:**
[List limitations in budget, headcount, tools, data access]
</constraints>

<behavioral_patterns>
**How They Currently Solve This Problem:**
[Describe their current workflow, tools used, workarounds, pain points]

**Decision-Making Style:**
[Describe how they evaluate options, what evidence they trust, risk tolerance]

**Collaboration Patterns:**
[Describe who they work with, communication preferences, meeting cadence]

**Learning Preferences:**
[Describe how they prefer to learn new tools, documentation vs. experimentation]
</behavioral_patterns>

<contextual_scenarios>
<scenario_1>
**Situation:** [Specific context: when, where, why]
**Goal:** [What they're trying to accomplish]
**Constraints:** [What's limiting them]
**Current Approach:** [How they do it now]
**Pain Points:** [What goes wrong or feels hard]
**Success Criteria:** [What "good" looks like]
</scenario_1>

<scenario_2>
[Repeat structure for 2-3 total scenarios covering different use cases]
</scenario_2>
</contextual_scenarios>

<design_implications>
[List 5-7 specific design implications from this user profile:
- "Must support quick, interrupted workflows due to frequent context-switching"
- "Should provide confidence-building validation since users fear making errors"
- "Must integrate with Slack since that's where they live all day"]
</design_implications>

<research_gaps>
[List specific things you don't know but should validate with real users:
- "How do they currently handle X scenario?"
- "What's their tolerance for Y type of complexity?"
- "How often do they encounter Z situation?"]
</research_gaps>

<validation_plan>
[Describe how to validate this profile with real users:
- Proposed research methods
- Key questions to ask
- Behaviors to observe
- Success signals that profile is accurate]
</validation_plan>
</actionable_user_profile>

FAILURE
- Any required section in `<actionable_user_profile>` is missing or materially incomplete.
- Profile remains generic/buzzword-heavy and not actionable for design decisions.
- Jobs, constraints, scenarios, or implications are not grounded in available data.
- Research gaps/validation plan are missing or non-specific.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
