INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- `{{USER_RESEARCH}}`: Interview notes, quotes, observations, transcripts.
- `{{MARKET_DATA}}`: Segment size, competitors, market trends.
- `{{BEHAVIORAL_INSIGHTS}}`: Analytics, JTBD signals, usage patterns.
- `{{DEMOGRAPHICS}}`: Age, location, income, education, and related profile context.
- `{{CONSTRAINTS}}` (optional): Industry, region, compliance, accessibility constraints.
- `{{PREFERENCES}}` (optional): `tone`, `depth` (`brief|standard|deep`), `number_of_personas` (default `1`).
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Synthesize mixed research inputs into concise, evidence-linked proto-persona profile(s) ready for early product decisions and validation.
Success metric:
- Persona profiles are internally consistent and clearly distinguish evidence from assumptions.
- Each profile includes confidence, explicit unknowns, and prioritized probing questions.
- Output follows required markdown canvas structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs; if data is missing, write `TBD` and cover it in Probing Questions.
- Extract concrete signals first (quotes, facts, metrics), then synthesize into pains/goals/behaviors.
- Clearly mark each claim as evidence-based or assumption with confidence (`High|Med|Low`).
- Use bracketed source tags (for example: `[UR#3]`, `[GA]`, `[MD]`) wherever evidence is cited.
- Avoid demographic stereotyping; unsupported demographics must be `TBD` or explicit assumptions.
- Ensure behaviors are observable and distinct from goals.
- If `number_of_personas > 1`, output distinct personas.
- Output markdown only; no JSON, XML, or HTML.
- Keep each persona under 400 words unless `depth = deep`.

FORMAT
- Return one markdown code block per persona.
- Inside each code block, render exactly this structure:

```markdown
# Proto Persona: {{Alliterative Name}}

## Bio & Demographics
- Age: {{x-y}}, Location: {{region/city}}, Education: {{...}}
- Role/Status: {{job title or life stage}}
- Income/Spending Power: {{range or TBD}}
- Household/Partner Status: {{...}}
- Digital/Channel Habits: {{top channels/devices}}
- Leisure & Interests: {{...}}
- Notable Constraints: {{time, budget, compliance, accessibility}}

## Representative Quotes
- "{{quote}}" - [{{source tag}}]
- "{{quote}}" - [{{source tag}}]
- "{{quote}}" - [{{source tag}}]

## Pains
- {{pain statement}} [evidence|assumption, {{confidence}}, {{source|TBD}}]
- {{...}}

## What They're Trying to Accomplish (Behaviors & JTBD)
- {{job story or observed behavior}} [evidence|assumption, {{confidence}}, {{source|TBD}}]
- {{...}}

## Goals
- {{goal}} [evidence|assumption, {{confidence}}, {{source|TBD}}]
- {{...}}

## Attitudes & Influences
- **Decision-Making Authority:** {{buyer|user|champion|blocker|none}} [{{confidence}}]
- **Decision Influencers:** {{roles/peers/communities}} [{{confidence}}]
- **Beliefs & Attitudes:** {{heuristics, risk posture, trust signals}} [{{confidence}}]

## Purchasing & Adoption Signals (Optional)
- Triggers: {{events that start the search}}
- Selection Criteria: {{top 3 decision criteria}}
- Objections: {{anticipated blockers}}
- Success Metrics: {{how they judge value}}

## Accessibility & Inclusion (Optional)
- Considerations: {{access, language, bandwidth, cognitive load}}

## Evidence & Confidence Summary
- Evidence Sources: {{list with counts, e.g., UR:6, GA:1, MD:2}}
- Assumptions: {{key assumptions}}
- Overall Confidence: {{High|Med|Low}} - {{1-2 sentence rationale}}

## Probing Questions (Prioritized)
1. {{highest-value unknown}}
2. {{next unknown}}
3. {{next unknown}}
```

FAILURE
- Output is not markdown code block(s), or required persona section headings are missing.
- `number_of_personas > 1` is requested but personas are not distinct or separated.
- Quotes/sources do not support key pains, goals, or JTBD claims.
- Claims are untagged (missing evidence/assumption + confidence + source markers).
- `TBD`/low-confidence gaps are not reflected in prioritized probing questions.
- Content exceeds 400 words per persona when `depth` is not `deep`.
- Output includes JSON/XML/HTML or generic filler not grounded in provided inputs.
