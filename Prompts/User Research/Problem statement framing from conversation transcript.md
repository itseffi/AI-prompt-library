INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- `{{SESSION_CONTEXT}}`: Conversation/session transcript and related context to analyze.
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Convert session context into a clear, empathetic, user-centered Problem Framing Canvas that stakeholders can use to align on the real problem before solutioning.
Success metric:
- The canvas accurately reflects transcript evidence and persona perspective.
- The narrative captures need, barriers, root cause, and emotional impact.
- The final problem statement is concise, actionable, and faithful to the input context.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `{{SESSION_CONTEXT}}`; if data is missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Perform all required analysis steps before writing the final canvas:
- Analyze persona, pain points, desired outcomes, barriers, root cause, emotional impact, and contextual constraints.
- Build a complete Problem Framing Narrative from the persona point of view.
- Enumerate relevant context and constraints (for example: geographic, technological, temporal, demographic, operational).
- Generate multiple candidate final statements internally, then select the strongest one.
- Keep claims evidence-based and grounded in transcript details.
- Final output must include only the finalized Problem Framing Canvas (no chain-of-thought, no extra sections).

FORMAT
Return only this final Markdown structure:

```markdown
## Problem Framing Canvas

### Problem Framing Narrative

I am:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

Trying to:
- [Desired outcomes]

But:
- [Barrier 1]
- [Barrier 2]
- [Barrier 3]

Because:
- [Root cause]

Which makes me feel:
- [Emotional impact]

### Context & Constraints

- [Factor 1]
- [Factor 2]
- [Factor 3]
...

### Final Problem Statement

[Concise problem statement]
```

Additional format rules:
- Keep headings exactly as shown.
- Maintain persona-first wording in the narrative.
- Use concise bullet points and avoid generic filler.

FAILURE
- Output is not exactly a `Problem Framing Canvas` in the required Markdown structure.
- Any required canvas section is missing or materially incomplete.
- Narrative is not written from persona perspective.
- Problem statement is vague, solution-biased, or not grounded in transcript evidence.
- Context/constraints are generic or irrelevant to provided input.
- Assumptions are required but not explicitly stated.
