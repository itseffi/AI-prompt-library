GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Fragmented user research synthesis into coherent insights.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Synthesize fragmented research inputs into coherent, evidence-based insights that inform design and product decisions.
- Use the provided inputs:
- `{{RESEARCH_INPUTS}}`
- `{{PRODUCT_CONTEXT}}`
- `{{DESIGN_QUESTIONS}}`
- `{{CURRENT_ASSUMPTIONS}}`
- `{{BUSINESS_GOALS}}`
- Perform synthesis rigorously:
- Inventory and assess source quality/coverage.
- Extract coded observations (quotes, behaviors, themes, segment/context metadata).
- Identify cross-source patterns and contradictions.
- Assign confidence levels with explicit rationale.
- Map insights to JTBD and user-needs hierarchy.
- Link insights directly to design questions and actionable recommendations.
- Identify research gaps, unresolved assumptions, and prioritized follow-up research.
- Keep evidence traceable, avoid over-generalization, and state assumptions/uncertainties explicitly.
