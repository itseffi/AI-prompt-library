GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: "Multi-step workflow optimization".
Success metric:
- Produces a full current-state workflow diagnosis with per-step friction and necessity classification.
- Proposes a lower-friction workflow that improves completion/time while preserving required safeguards.
- Includes a measurable validation plan (A/B or staged rollout) and post-launch iteration logic.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs; if data is missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Analyze the current workflow end-to-end before proposing changes.
- Provide per-step diagnosis including purpose, required inputs, validation, completion/time, errors, friction type, and necessity.
- Identify top friction points across redundancy, repetition, validation friction, progress clarity, save/resume, cognitive load, technical friction, and emotional friction.
- Propose optimizations that reduce steps/time/drop-off while preserving required legal, security, and quality checkpoints.
- Keep recommendations specific, testable, and measurable against baseline metrics.
- Include experimentation and rollout plan with success criteria, rollback conditions, and post-launch monitoring.
- If exact metrics are unavailable, provide directional estimates and clearly mark them as assumptions.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<workflow_optimization>
<executive_summary>
**Current State:**
- Total steps: [X]
- Average completion rate: [Y%]
- Average time to complete: [Z minutes]
- Primary drop-off point: [Step N - why]

**Proposed State:**
- Total steps: [X - reduced by N]
- Expected completion rate: [Y + N%]
- Expected time to complete: [Z - N minutes]
- Key improvements: [3-5 bullet points]

**Expected Impact:**
- [Metric]: [Current → Target]
- [Metric]: [Current → Target]
- [Business impact]: [e.g., "10% increase in signups = $X additional revenue/month"]
</executive_summary>

<current_workflow_analysis>
**Overall Metrics:**
- Steps: [Total count]
- Completion Rate: [X% - what percent of users who start actually finish]
- Average Time: [Minutes/seconds]
- Median Time: [If significantly different from average, indicates confusion for some users]
- Abandonment Rate: [100 - completion rate]

**Drop-off Analysis:**
- Step 1: [Name] - [Y% complete this step] - [W% abandon]
- Step 2: [Name] - [Y% complete] - [W% abandon] ⚠️ [High drop-off? Why?]
- Step 3: [Name] - [Y% complete] - [W% abandon]
- [Continue for all steps]

**Top 3 Friction Points:**
1. [Step/Issue]: [X% abandon] - [Why this is painful]
2. [Step/Issue]: [Y% abandon] - [Why this is painful]
3. [Step/Issue]: [Z% abandon] - [Why this is painful]

**Detailed Step Analysis:**

For each step, provide:

**Step 1: [Name]**
- **What user does:** [Actions required - e.g., "Enter name, email, phone number"]
- **Why step exists:** [Purpose - e.g., "Account creation requires contact info"]
- **Inputs required:** [List of fields]
  - [Field]: [Required/Optional] - [Source of data - user memory, lookup, calculation]
- **Validation:** [What's checked - e.g., "Email format, phone number format"]
- **Completion rate:** [X%] - [Y% drop off at this step]
- **Average time:** [Z seconds]
- **Common errors:** [What goes wrong - e.g., "15% of users enter invalid email format"]
- **Friction type:** [Redundant/Complex/Unclear/Tedious/Unnecessary]
- **Problem statement:** [What makes this step difficult or annoying]
- **Necessity:** ✅ Required (cannot remove) / ⚠️ Required but could be improved / ❌ Unnecessary (can remove or defer)

**Step 2: [Name]**
[Same detailed structure]

[Continue for all steps]

FAILURE
- Any required section/tag from `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or materially incomplete.
- Current workflow analysis lacks per-step necessity or friction classification.
- Proposed optimizations remove required safeguards without justification.
- Testing plan lacks control/variant definition or clear decision criteria.
- Monitoring plan lacks actionable metrics or iteration logic.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
