INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{EDGE_CASE_SCENARIO}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Solution design for edge cases in product development.
Success metric:
- Clearly explains why the scenario is rare but critical and its user/business impact.
- Proposes and evaluates at least 3 distinct solution approaches.
- Recommends a balanced solution that resolves the edge case without overcomplicating the core flow.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `{{EDGE_CASE_SCENARIO}}`; if details are missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Start with scenario diagnosis before solutioning.
- Generate at least 3 approaches spanning minimal to comprehensive change.
- Evaluate each approach on:
  - effectiveness for the edge case,
  - impact on core users,
  - implementation complexity,
  - scalability/risk.
- Recommend one approach with clear tradeoff rationale.
- Prioritize minimal added complexity to the primary user journey.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<solution>
<scenario_analysis>
- Core issue: [What fails and why]
- Why rare but critical: [Frequency + severity]
- Affected users and impact: [Who is impacted and consequence]
</scenario_analysis>

<solution_options>
1. [Option name] - [Approach summary]
2. [Option name] - [Approach summary]
3. [Option name] - [Approach summary]
[Optional additional options]
</solution_options>

<option_evaluation>
- [Option name]:
  - Pros: [Bullets]
  - Cons: [Bullets]
  - Complexity: [Low/Medium/High + note]
  - Core experience impact: [Low/Medium/High + note]
  - Scalability: [Assessment]
- [Repeat for each option]
</option_evaluation>

<summary>
Briefly describe your recommended solution in 2-3 sentences.
</summary>

<rationale>
Explain your reasoning for choosing this solution, including:
- How it addresses the edge case
- Why it's preferable to other options
- How it minimizes impact on the core experience
</rationale>

<implementation>
Provide a high-level overview of how to implement this solution, including:
- Any necessary changes to the user interface
- Backend modifications required
- Potential challenges in implementation and how to address them
</implementation>

<user_communication>
Suggest how to communicate this change to users, if necessary. This may include:
- Updates to documentation
- In-app notifications or tooltips
- Changes to onboarding processes
</user_communication>
</solution>

FAILURE
- Any required section/tag in `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Fewer than 3 solution options are provided.
- No explicit evaluation is provided for one or more options.
- Recommendation is not traceable to the option tradeoff analysis.
- Recommendation over-engineers the core flow without justification.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
