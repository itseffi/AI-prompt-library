INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{PRODUCT}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Generate 12 high-quality CTA options for `PRODUCT`, organized by 4 copywriting strategies.
Success metric:
- Exactly 12 CTAs are provided (3 per strategy).
- Every CTA follows length constraints and includes character count.
- CTA wording is specific to `PRODUCT` and non-duplicative.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `PRODUCT` as input context.
- Create exactly 12 unique CTAs: 3 for each strategy.
- Use these strategy groups exactly:
  - Match the feeling
  - Actionable next step
  - Handle the objection
  - Make it specific
- Each CTA must be 6-35 characters (including spaces).
- Target average CTA length around 25 characters across all 12.
- Keep wording product-specific and action-oriented; avoid generic placeholders.
- Include character count after every CTA.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<output>
1. Match the feeling  
   a. [CTA] (XX characters)  
   b. [CTA] (XX characters)  
   c. [CTA] (XX characters)  

2. Actionable next step  
   a. [CTA] (XX characters)  
   b. [CTA] (XX characters)  
   c. [CTA] (XX characters)  

3. Handle the objection  
   a. [CTA] (XX characters)  
   b. [CTA] (XX characters)  
   c. [CTA] (XX characters)  

4. Make it specific  
   a. [CTA] (XX characters)  
   b. [CTA] (XX characters)  
   c. [CTA] (XX characters)  
</output>

FAILURE
- Not exactly 12 CTAs, or not exactly 3 per strategy group.
- Any CTA is outside 6-35 characters, or character counts are missing/incorrect.
- CTAs are repetitive, generic, or not tailored to `PRODUCT`.
- Required output schema/order is missing or malformed.
