INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{FEATURE_OR_PROJECT}}
- {{CONTEXT}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Features reframing and projects Shape Up.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Reframe `{{FEATURE_OR_PROJECT}}` using Shape Up principles and provided `{{CONTEXT}}`.
- Provide a shaped work definition that is concrete enough for delivery but avoids build-phase implementation detail.
- Include:
- Appetite assessment (`1-2 weeks` or `6 weeks`) with rationale.
- Problem framing (problem-first, not solution-first).
- Boundary definition (in-scope / out-of-scope).
- Solution sketch at fat-marker level.
- Risks/rabbit holes and circuit-breakers.
- Explicit no-gos.
- Executive constraint language to secure scope commitment and prevent mid-cycle scope creep.
- Keep output focused on shaping quality, delivery constraints, and stakeholder alignment.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

Shape Up Reframe

Appetite Assessment
- Recommended appetite: [1-2 weeks or 6 weeks]
- Why this appetite: [rationale]

Problem Framing
- Core problem: [problem statement]
- Why this matters now: [impact/context]
- Success condition: [what success looks like]

Boundary Definition
- In scope:
  - [item]
- Out of scope:
  - [item]

Solution Sketching (Fat Marker Level)
- Key approach: [high-level approach]
- Main interaction/surface 1: [conceptual behavior]
- Main interaction/surface 2: [conceptual behavior]

Risks and Rabbit Holes
- [risk/rabbit hole]
- Circuit-breaker: [constraint or stop-rule]

No-gos
- [explicit exclusion]

Executive Constraints
- Commitment language: [specific wording to secure scope agreement]
- Change-control rule: [how new requests are handled mid-cycle]
- Escalation path: [who decides if scope must change]

Assumptions
- [assumption or "None"]

FAILURE
- Any required section is missing or materially incomplete.
- Output drifts into build-phase implementation details instead of shaping-level decisions.
- Boundaries/no-gos are vague or do not constrain scope.
- Executive constraint handling is missing or not actionable.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
