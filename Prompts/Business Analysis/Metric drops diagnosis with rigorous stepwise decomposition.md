- {{METRIC_NAME}}
- {{FORMULA}}

GOAL
Diagnose the root cause of a metric drop using stepwise decomposition from metric-level to driver-level to segment-level causes.
Success metric:
- Identifies whether the drop is real vs artifact.
- Isolates top driver(s), break timing, and highest-impact segment(s).
- Produces 1-3 testable hypotheses with confirm/refute criteria and next actions.
- Follows the required output structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Analyze in this exact sequence:
  1. Confirm drop validity (artifact checks).
  2. Decompose metric into 2-3 drivers from formula.
  3. Trend drivers to find break timing/pattern.
  4. Segment culprit driver and rank impact.
  5. Compare bad vs stable segments.
  6. Produce 1-3 ranked, testable hypotheses.
- For each subproblem include:
  - Goal
  - Method (queries/breakdowns/plots)
  - Decision rule
  - Findings
  - Next step
- Use explicit calculations where possible (delta or contribution attribution).
- If SQL schema is incomplete, provide minimal-field request plus pseudocode with placeholders.
- Always label confidence (`High`, `Med`, `Low`) and all assumptions.
- Do not stop at symptom-level statements; identify driver, segment, break date, and likely causal mechanism.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<metric_drop_diagnosis>
<subproblem_1>
[Goal, method, decision rule, findings, next step]
[Include table: period -> metric -> numerator/denominator -> data quality signals]
[Verdict: Real drop | Measurement artifact | Baseline skew]
</subproblem_1>
<subproblem_2>
[Driver tree]
[Driver table: driver -> baseline -> current -> % change -> contribution]
[Top culprit driver(s)]
</subproblem_2>
<subproblem_3>
[Break-date analysis by driver: break date, pattern (step/gradual), confidence]
[Candidate correlates from KNOWN_EVENTS]
</subproblem_3>
<subproblem_4>
[Impact-ranked segment table: segment -> baseline -> current -> delta -> volume share -> impact score]
[Largest contributing segment or broad-based note]
</subproblem_4>
<subproblem_5>
[Side-by-side comparison of bad vs stable segments]
[3-5 discriminative differences with numbers]
</subproblem_5>
<subproblem_6>
[1-3 ranked hypotheses]

FAILURE
- Any required subproblem section is missing or out of sequence.
- Output lacks methods/decision rules/findings/next-step per subproblem.
- No driver decomposition or no impact-ranked segmentation.
- Hypotheses are not testable (missing confirm/refute criteria).
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions or confidence labels are missing.
- Required schema is malformed or incomplete.
