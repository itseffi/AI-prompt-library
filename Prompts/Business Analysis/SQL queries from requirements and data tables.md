INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{DATA_TABLES_OVERVIEW}}
- {{QUERY_CRAFTING_REQUIREMENTS}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Produce a correct, performant, and maintainable SQL query from `DATA_TABLES_OVERVIEW` and `QUERY_CRAFTING_REQUIREMENTS`.
Success metric:
- SQL satisfies requirements and uses valid joins/filters/aggregations.
- Query is optimized for readability and execution efficiency.
- Major logic choices and assumptions are clearly explained.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required SQL design steps:
  - relevant table joins,
  - filter conditions,
  - aggregations/calculations,
  - subqueries/CTEs where helpful.
- Prefer explicit selected columns (avoid `SELECT *` unless explicitly required).
- Use meaningful aliases and readable formatting.
- Add concise inline comments only for non-obvious logic.
- Include assumptions when schema or requirements are ambiguous.
- If requirements are under-specified, produce best-effort SQL and state what data/constraints would finalize it.
- Default policy for ambiguities (apply unless `QUERY_CRAFTING_REQUIREMENTS` explicitly overrides):
  - **Top-5 rule:** return exactly 5 rows per month using `ROW_NUMBER()` with deterministic tie-break (`ORDER BY net_revenue_usd DESC, category ASC`).
  - **Multi-category revenue attribution:** allocate order revenue proportionally by category share of item extended value (`quantity * unit_price`) within each order; do not attribute full order revenue to every category.
  - **Payment-attempt attribution by category:** attribute payment attempts/failures to each category touched by an order (order-category level attribution), and explicitly disclose that summed category-level counts can exceed overall totals.
  - **Payment time scope:** when reporting period filters are defined for orders, filter payment attempts to the same period using `payments.attempted_at` unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- SQL must be executable with standard ASCII SQL syntax:
  - Use `'single quotes'` for string literals.
  - Use `--` for line comments.
  - Do not use typographic quotes/dashes or other smart punctuation.
- Keep explanation plain text (no unusual control characters, copy artifacts, or decorative bullets).
- If metrics are attributed to multiple categories (for multi-category orders), explicitly state that totals across categories may exceed overall order/payment totals.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<sql_query>
-- SQL query with formatting and comments
</sql_query>
<query_explanation>
- Join strategy and why each join type is used
- Filter logic and business-rule mapping
- Aggregations/calculations rationale
- Performance considerations (indexes, cardinality, scan reduction, CTE/subquery choices)
- Assumptions and known limitations
</query_explanation>

FAILURE
- Missing `<sql_query>` or `<query_explanation>` section.
- SQL does not match stated requirements.
- Uses `SELECT *` without explicit requirement.
- Join/filter/aggregation logic is unclear or unsupported in explanation.
- SQL contains non-ASCII smart punctuation that breaks execution (e.g., `‘ ’`, `“ ”`, `–`).
- Explanation contains copy artifacts or unreadable formatting.
- Output violates default ambiguity policies (top-5 cardinality, revenue attribution, payment attribution, or payment time scope) without explicit requirement override.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
