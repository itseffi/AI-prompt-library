GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Defining the niche from user input.
Success metric:

- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Follow these task requirements:
<task_requirements>
- Analyze input for: audience demographics, interests/behaviors, geography/context, product/service attributes, and unique value points.
- Each niche must combine multiple dimensions (at least 3 of: demographics, interests, geography/context, use case, value driver).
- Avoid broad segments; each niche should be narrow enough to target with specific messaging.
- Do not invent unrelated industries, audiences, or value propositions not implied by `USER_INPUT`.
- Ensure all 10 niches are materially different from each other.
