INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{PRD_KNOWN_INFORMATION}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Draft a complete PRD from `PRD_KNOWN_INFORMATION`, using explicit assumptions where information is missing.
Success metric:
- Covers all required PRD sections in actionable detail.
- Includes clear metrics and impact sizing logic with transparent assumptions.
- Produces focused follow-up questions for critical unknowns.
- Follows the required output structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Use the exact PRD heading/table structure specified in `FORMAT`.
- Start from known information, then extend with clearly labeled assumptions.
- Keep language precise, unambiguous, and implementation-oriented for design/engineering stakeholders.
- Ensure metrics are measurable and prioritization logic is explicit.
- Keep non-goals and risks explicit to reduce scope ambiguity.
- Use markdown-friendly structure inside the PRD for readability.
- Output follow-up questions only for meaningful unknowns that affect decision quality.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<PRD>
# [Product Name]

## About
[High-level overview of the product and goal.]

## Market Insights
[Market context, competitors, trends, and target users.]

## Problem
[Core user problem, pain points, and why existing solutions are insufficient.]

## Solution
[Proposed AI product solution and how it addresses the problem.]

## Feature Prioritization
| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Requirements
**Functional Requirements:**
- FR1:
- FR2:
- FR3:

**AI/ML Model Requirements:**
- MR1:
- MR2:
- MR3:

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- NFR1:

## Challenges
[Key product, technical, data, and go-to-market challenges.]

## Positioning
| Use Case | Target User | Key Benefit | Differentiator |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

## Metrics
[Success metrics and north star metric.]

## Rollout Plan
- **Stakeholders & Communication**
  - [Stakeholder groups and communication plan]

- **Roll-out Strategy**
  - [Launch phases, gating criteria, and post-GA plan]
</PRD>
<QUESTIONS>
[Follow-up questions for major assumptions, missing information, or high-risk unknowns]
</QUESTIONS>

FAILURE
- Any required section/table/list item pattern from `FORMAT` is missing or materially incomplete.
- Metrics/prioritization are vague, unquantified, or unsupported.
- Content is generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Required output schema (`<PRD>`, `<QUESTIONS>`) is missing or malformed.
- Major unknowns, dependencies, or assumption-sensitive decisions are not captured in `<QUESTIONS>`.
