INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{FRW_DRAFT}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Evaluate an FRW draft rigorously and produce both prioritized feedback and a stronger rewritten FRW with placeholders where data is missing.
Success metric:
- Feedback identifies critical analytical and reporting issues in priority order.
- Rewritten FRW demonstrates sound experimentation logic, statistical interpretation, and business relevance.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Follow these task requirements:
<task_requirements>
- Review `FRW_DRAFT` thoroughly for:
  - statistical validity/significance claims,
  - methodology clarity/completeness,
  - interpretation quality,
  - alignment to business goals,
  - potential bias/confounding factors,
  - actionability and decision-readiness,
  - structure and narrative flow.
- Provide prioritized feedback (highest-risk issues first), including:
  - strengths,
  - issues and improvements,
  - additional metrics/data recommendations,
  - presentation/communication improvements,
  - stronger conclusion/recommendation guidance.
- Rewrite the FRW with placeholders where data is absent.
- In the rewrite, include at minimum:
  - experiment context/objective,
  - methodology and guardrails,
  - results with statistical interpretation,
  - business impact interpretation,
  - risks/limitations,
  - recommendations and next actions.
- Mark assumptions and placeholders explicitly (e.g., `[ASSUMPTION]`, `[PLACEHOLDER_METRIC]`).
</task_requirements>

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<Feedback>
[Detailed, prioritized feedback with clear subheadings]
</Feedback>
<Rewritten_FRW>
[Complete rewritten FRW using placeholders and explicit assumptions where needed]
</Rewritten_FRW>

FAILURE
- Output misses required sections, steps, or reasoning required by `<task_requirements>`.
- Required format/schema is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
