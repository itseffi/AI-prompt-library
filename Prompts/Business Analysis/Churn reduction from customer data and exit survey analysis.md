GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Churn reduction from customer data and exit survey analysis.
Success metric:
- Completes all required tasks and decision logic from the prompt instructions.
- Output is specific, evidence-based, and actionable.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip required analysis steps, sections, or validation logic.
- Keep recommendations/outputs grounded in the input context; avoid generic filler.
- Follow these task requirements:
<task_requirements>
- Use only evidence from `CHURN_DATA`, `EXIT_SURVEY_RESPONSES`, and `ACTIVE_CUSTOMERS_BY_PERIOD_COHORT`; if data is missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Use these metric definitions:
  - Customer churn rate = `churned_customers_in_period / active_customers_start`.
  - MRR churn rate = `churned_mrr_in_period_usd / active_mrr_start_usd`.
  - "Average customer lifetime" must be labeled as `churned-user tenure proxy` unless full customer lifecycle data is provided.
- Compute churn rate using denominator data from `ACTIVE_CUSTOMERS_BY_PERIOD_COHORT`; include overall and cohort-level rates when possible.
- If denominator data is insufficient for any requested slice, state "not computable for this slice" and use explicit proxy metrics (churn events, churned MRR) for that slice.
- Analyze both quantitative patterns (rate, lifetime, segment/time trends) and qualitative churn reasons (theme categories from exits).
- Prioritize interventions by estimated impact x feasibility.
- Include short-term (0-30 days), medium-term (31-90 days), and long-term (90+ days) actions.
- Every recommendation must trace to a specific churn reason or segment pattern.
- For each prioritized key insight, provide at least one specific strategy.
- If churned-user sample counts in `CHURN_DATA`/`EXIT_SURVEY_RESPONSES` differ from denominator totals in `ACTIVE_CUSTOMERS_BY_PERIOD_COHORT`, explicitly disclose the mismatch and treat sample-derived insights as directional.
- Do not add impact estimates from overlapping cohorts (e.g., `incident_exposed` and `price_change_seen`) as if independent; call out overlap risk.
- Do not give generic advice without a data link.
</task_requirements>

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<churn_reduction_plan>
1. Data Analysis Summary
- Current churn rate (overall + by key period/cohort), churned-user tenure proxy, and relevant baseline metrics
- Denominator coverage check (which churn rates are computable vs not computable)
- Sample alignment check (sample sizes, coverage, and mismatch disclosure if present)
- Churned-user profile patterns (segments, behavior, timing)
- Exit-survey theme breakdown with frequency or relative weight

2. Key Insights (3-5, prioritized)
- Insight title
- Evidence (data points/themes supporting it)
- Why it matters for churn reduction

3. Targeted Strategies
- Linked insight:
- Issue to solve:
- Action plan:
- Time horizon: Short-term | Medium-term | Long-term
- Owner suggestion:
- Success metrics (leading + lagging):
- Expected effect on churn:

4. Monitoring and Adjustment
- Review cadence
- Instrumentation and dashboard checks
- Decision rules for doubling down, iterating, or stopping actions

5. Expected Impact
- Estimated churn reduction range using scenario bands: Conservative | Base | Aggressive
- Time to observe impact
- Key assumptions and risks
</churn_reduction_plan>

FAILURE
- Output misses required sections, steps, or reasoning required by `<task_requirements>`.
- Required format/schema is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
