INPUTS
<provided_inputs>
- {{CONVERSATION_TRANSCRIPT}}
- {{CONTEXT}}
</provided_inputs>

GOAL
Convert `CONVERSATION_TRANSCRIPT` (+ `CONTEXT`) into a MECE-structured requirements set, then provide a rigorous self-critique of extraction quality.
Success metric:
- Requirements are clear, actionable, and grouped with MECE logic.
- Each requirement is source-traceable and includes dependency/relationship notes where relevant.
- Self-criticism identifies weaknesses without proposing solutions.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs and clearly state assumptions when information is missing.
- Do not skip these analysis steps:
  1. Identify explicit requests, constraints, concerns, and implied needs.
  2. Organize requirements into MECE categories / issue-tree logic.
  3. Write requirements in precise, actionable language.
  4. Annotate source traceability and dependency relationships.
- Keep language unambiguous and implementation-relevant without over-specifying design/engineering internals.
- In self-criticism, identify issues only; do not propose fixes.
- Explicitly label assumptions inferred from context.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<requirements_analysis>
<executive_summary>[Main themes and scope]</executive_summary>
<requirements_categories>[MECE categories and issue-tree structure]</requirements_categories>
<individual_requirements>[Numbered requirements per category with source/dependency notes]</individual_requirements>
<dependencies_and_relationships>[Cross-references between requirements]</dependencies_and_relationships>
<assumptions>[Implied assumptions not explicitly stated in transcript]</assumptions>
</requirements_analysis>
<self_criticism>
<inconsistencies>[List only]</inconsistencies>
<contradictions>[List only]</contradictions>
<over_specification>[List only]</over_specification>
<under_specification>[List only]</under_specification>
<missing_elements>[List only]</missing_elements>
<scope_creep>[List only]</scope_creep>
</self_criticism>

FAILURE
- Any required schema section is missing or malformed.
- Requirements are generic, non-actionable, or not traceable to transcript/context.
- MECE structure is absent or internally overlapping/confusing.
- Self-criticism includes solution proposals instead of issue identification only.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
