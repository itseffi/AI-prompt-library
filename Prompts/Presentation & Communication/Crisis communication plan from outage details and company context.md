GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Crisis communication plan from outage details and company context.
Success metric:
- Produces both a stakeholder communication plan and an internal post-mortem framework.
- Communication plan is empathetic, transparent, role-specific, and time-sequenced.
- Post-mortem framework is actionable with root cause analysis, lessons, and owners/deadlines.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS

- Prioritize stakeholders by outage impact and urgency.
- For each stakeholder group include:
  - tailored message (acknowledgment, empathy, immediate actions),
  - channel(s),
  - cadence/timeline,
  - spokesperson and key talking points.
- Post-mortem framework must include:
  - incident timeline,
  - response team,
  - root cause analysis,
  - stakeholder/business impact,
  - lessons learned,
  - action items with owners and deadlines.
- Keep tone aligned with company values/style in `{{COMPANY_CONTEXT}}`.
