GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Press releases from product vision (Working Backwards).
Success metric:
- Produces a credible Working Backwards-style launch press release that is specific and evidence-backed.
- Includes exactly two quotes (executive + customer/partner) and at least one concrete proof point.
- Clearly states availability/pricing/requirements and a direct call to action.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only provided inputs; if required launch details are missing, use bracketed placeholders like `[CITY]`, `[DATE]`, `[STAT]`.
- If placeholders are used, append a short `Fill These Gaps` checklist once after the release.
- Output must be Markdown only (no XML/JSON wrappers).
- Target length: 350-550 words (plus Media Contact block).
- Tone: visionary but plain-spoken, AP-style clarity, active voice, short paragraphs.
- Avoid hype words (for example `revolutionary`, `game-changing`) unless in quotes.
- Include at least one concrete proof point (metric, benchmark, ROI, independent signal, certification, or analyst note).
- Include exactly two quotes:
  - one executive quote (vision/why now),
  - one customer/partner quote (outcome/benefit).
- Use the structure labels in `FORMAT` verbatim.
- Convert each feature into a clear user/business outcome.
- No unverifiable regulated claims, no competitor bashing, no guaranteed-future promises.

FAILURE
- Required section labels from `FORMAT` are missing, renamed, malformed, or incomplete.
- Word count is materially outside 350-550 (excluding Media Contact).
- Not exactly two quotes, or quotes are not executive + customer/partner types.
- No concrete proof point is included.
- Feature bullets do not translate to outcomes.
- Placeholder gaps exist but `Fill These Gaps` is missing.
- Output contains XML/JSON wrappers.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
