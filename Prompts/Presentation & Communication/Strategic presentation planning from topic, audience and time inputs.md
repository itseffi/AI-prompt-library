GOAL
Produce a high-quality deliverable for: Strategic presentation planning from topic, audience and time inputs.
Success metric:
- Produces a complete presentation framework tailored to topic, audience, and time constraint.
- Includes a concrete audience matrix, SCQA narrative, and pyramid logic with supporting evidence needs.
- Provides slide layout guidance and delivery preparation tuned to the audience.
- Output follows the required structure exactly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Use only `{{PRESENTATION_TOPIC}}`, `{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}`, and `{{TIME_CONSTRAINT}}`; if context is missing, state assumptions explicitly.
- Build a strategic foundation with a detailed audience matrix and explicit purpose/decision criteria.
- Use SCQA for narrative framing and pyramid logic for justification structure.
- Provide slide layout strategy tied to content types and time constraint.
- Include QA checks and delivery preparation tailored to audience and time.

FORMAT
Return exactly this structure:

<framework>
1. Strategic Foundation
   [Include your audience analysis and presentation purpose definition]

2. Narrative Architecture
   [Present your SCQA framework and Pyramid Principle structure]

3. Slide Development
   [Outline your slide selection strategy and design principles]

4. Quality Assurance
   [List key points for review]

5. Preparation & Delivery
   [Provide notes on content mastery and delivery adaptation]
</framework>

FAILURE
- Any required numbered section in `FORMAT` is missing, malformed, or incomplete.
- Audience analysis lacks a matrix across power, expertise, bias, history, style, and politics.
- SCQA or pyramid logic is missing or not tied to the topic.
- Slide development guidance does not reflect time constraint or content type.
- QA checks are missing or superficial.
- Claims are generic or not grounded in provided inputs.
- Assumptions are used but not explicitly stated.
